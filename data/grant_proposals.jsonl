In \n2011, \n assisted the Museum in upgrading the Curtiss Jenny exhibit in the J. \nElroy McCaw Personal Courage Wing, and in 2013, provided us with a challenge grant for the successful \nrefurbishment of our SPAD S.XIII (S.13). We are very grateful for your partnership in our efforts \nthroughout the years to bring aviation history back to life in such an enriching manner. \nI'm reaching out now to invite the \n to assist The Museum of Flight with a very \nimportant capital improvement project, one that will impact every major aircraft restoration project the \nMuseum embarks on in the future. The buildings housing the Museum's Restoration Center and Reserve \nCollection (RCRC) are in need of renovations to improve the safety and effectiveness of the working \nenvironment and increase energy efficiency. \nThe RCRC is located at Paine Field in Everett, Washington- 32 miles north of the Museum's main \ncampus at Boeing Field - and comprised of two hangars: C-72 & C-73. The smaller hangar, C-73, was \nbuilt it 1979, and the larger hangar, C-72, which also houses office and classroom spaces, was built in \n1985. The Museum of Flight began using the facility to restore and preserve historic aircraft in 1988, and \nentered into a twenty-year lease with Snohomish County in 2010. \nEvery aircraft brought to the 23,000-square-foot facility undergoes a thorough evaluation to determine the \nnature and scope of the work needed. Following this evaluation, an experienced team of volunteers is \nassembled who have the necessary skills to complete the work correctly. The RCRC is home to \napproximately three dozen aircraft in varying states of restoration, plus finished aircraft and hundreds of \naviation artifacts on display. This working hangar is open to the public where visitors can get very close \nto projects in progress and interact with the restoration volunteers, some of whom have been working on \naircraft for decades, even after retiring from the aviation industry. \nThe hangars were originally built as storage spaces, not work spaces. In 2011, a grant from the \n \n supported upgrades to the lighting in both buildings, which improved the safety and \neffectiveness of the space and reduced energy costs. Renovations have also been completed on the main \nlobby, including carpeting, painting, and exhibits upgrades. The gutter system on the hangars has also \nbeen repaired or replaced where necessary. \nI \n'* THE MUSEUM OF FLIGHT 9404 East Marginal Way South, Seattle, Washington 98108-4097 • inspirationbeginshere.org"}, {"page": 2, "paragraph": 1, "text": "Upgrades are needed on both buildings to protect the volunteers and artifacts from the Pacific Northwest's \ncool damp climate.

The Museum’s vision is to be the foremost educational air and space museum in the \nworld. \n \nBRIEF HISTORY: \nIn 1965, a small group of aviation enthusiasts established the Pacific Northwest Aviation \nHistorical Foundation (PNAHF) with the goals of saving significant aircraft and related artifacts, \nand educating the public about their importance. When the Port of Seattle leased land to the \nPNAHF in 1975, a permanent home was established that would house The Red Barn ®, the \nbirthplace of The Boeing Company. As the Museum collection grew, new galleries, collections \nstorage, visitor services and administrative office space were built to enhance the Museum’s \nability to care for the collection and use it to educate and inspire visitors. In the summer of 2016, \na new 140,000 square foot Aviation Pavilion will open to the public nearly doubling the \nMuseum’s protected exhibit and education space. The Pavilion will cover 18 of the Museum’s \nlarge and most iconic aircraft such as the first Boeing 747, 727 and 737 which recently made its \nfinal flight from the RCRC to the Museum’s main campus. \n \nToday, the Museum is one of the largest air and space museums in the world, attracting more \nthan 525,000 visitors in 2015 to enjoy exhibits and participate in educational and public \nprograms, and group events. We hold one of the most comprehensive air and space collections in \nthe United States including more than 150 air- and space-craft, thousands of small objects, \n90,000 books and periodicals and nearly 5,000 cubic feet of archival materials including an \nestimated four million photographic images.  \n \nThe Museum continues to deliver on its vision by expanding our role as a leader in the delivery \nof informal science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education programs in \nWashington State. Museum staff impacted nearly 160,000 pre-K-12 students and teachers in \n2015 through 2,040 onsite and outreach education programs. Our goal is to increase this number \nto 220,000 annually by 2020. Gender, ethnicity and income level are all factors that can \ndiscourage a young person from pursuing a college education, especially in science, technology \nand engineering fields. The Museum’s goal is to serve at least 50% of our annual youth \neducation participants from these underrepresented populations. \n \n \nHOW FUNDS WILL BE USED: \nFunds from this grant will support repair and renovation work on the Museum’s Restoration \nCenter and Reserve Collection (RCRC) buildings, which are in need of improvements to increase \nsafety and effectiveness of the working environment and increase energy efficiency.

For \nthis Collaboration project, the Health Centers are partnering with UVa Comprehensive Cancer \nCenter, one of two NCI-designated cancer centers in Virginia. With the Center’s partners at the \nUniversity of Virginia (UVA), the ACSRC2 will implement evidence-based practices for cancer \nscreening navigation and community outreach tailored to each Health Center’s identified needs. \nThere are a total of twelve (12) clinical sites operated by the two Community Health Centers \nengaged in this project. These are listed in the Project/Performance site location form.   \n  \nAxCRS project partners  \n     Central Virginia Health Services (CVHS) is a community-based, non-profit that provides \nintegrated health care for adults and children. It operates 20 health care centers located across \ncentral Virginia, serving fifteen counties and four cities. Services include medical, dental, and \nbehavioral health, with an in-house pharmacy for patients’ medication needs. Affordable \nmedications and visits via telehealth are available. The focus is on affordable and accessible care \nfor medically underserved individuals, including non-English speaking people. Poverty, \ngeographic isolation, too few primary care providers or no dental or mental health services \ncharacterize CVHS communities. Each community has unique characteristics and over half are \nrural. Founded in 1970 by community activists in the medically underserved rural counties of \nBuckingham, Cumberland, and Fluvanna, CVHS is Virginia’s first and largest community health \ncenter. Its mission is to provide safe, accessible, affordable, comprehensive, high quality and \nculturally sensitive health services. Providers include patients as partners in achieving or \nmaintaining their optimal health. The ACSRC2 project will focus on the CVHS clinic sites that \nare within the UVACCC catchment area before expanding the screening initiatives to additional \nhealth system sites within CVHS. In 2021 CVHS served 48,226 patients through 192,217 visits.  \n  \n     Tri Area Community Health (TACH) is a Community Health Center that operates five sites in \nthe Blue Ridge Mountain region of Southwest Virginia and has served the area for over 40 years. \nCarroll County is served by a clinic and pharmacy located in Laurel Fork; Floyd County is \nserved by a clinic located in the Town of Floyd; Franklin County is served by a clinic and \npharmacy in Ferrum; Grayson County is served by a clinic in Troutdale (Grayson Highlands); \nand Patrick County is served through a collaboration between Tri-Area and Patrick County \nFamily Practice (a Rural Health Clinic) and Caring Hearts Free Clinic in the Town of Stuart. \nComprehensive primary medical and behavioral health services are provided by TACH at all \nsites except Stuart, where TACH provides behavioral health to complement the medical care \noffered by the existing rural health clinic and free clinic.

Both the unemployment rate and the uninsured rate are several \npercentage points higher than the Virginia rate, according to the 2021 County Health Rankings. \nIn 2021 TACH served 10,133 patients through 33,933 patient visits.  \n  \n     UVA Comprehensive Cancer Center (UVACC) The UVA Comprehensive Cancer Center \nserves over 3.2 million residents from 87 counties throughout rural Virginia and West Virginia, \nincluding the 27 counties served by CVHS and TACH. A cornerstone of UVACCC is the \nCommunity Outreach and Engagement (COE) program, with almost two decades of commitment \nto ensuring access to effective cancer control strategies to improve the lives of residents and \ncancer patients regardless of distance, insurance, or poverty status. UVACC’s Office for \nCommunity Outreach and Engagement (OCOE) 1) supports community-academic partnerships, \n2) facilitates community input for investigators, and 3) increases the capacity of research in \ncommunities that is responsive to the pressing health concerns of community members in the \ncatchment area. OCOE has an office at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, but also has \n3 full-time outreach specialists living and working in regions across the catchment area with the \nmost pressing cancer control needs. The area that CVHS serves is within driving distance of the \nOCOE main office. TACH’s service area is within driving distance of outreach specialists in its \nsatellite locations in Danville and in Wise County where UVA has a campus.  \n  \n     Guided by the principles of community engagement, OCOE including outreach specialists \nand Navigators, will deliver culturally adapted, evidence-based interventions, screening services, \nand education to enhance the well-being of individuals, organizations, and communities across \nthe catchment area. OCOE collaborates with more than 100 community partners including \nnumerous federally qualified health centers, government officials, healthcare providers, \nfaithbased leaders, and state coalitions. Through partnerships they have successfully facilitated \nover 11,000 cancer screenings and reached more than 20,000 individuals through evidence-based \nprogramming over the past five years.  \n  \n     UVA Cancer Center’s COE team has longstanding relationships with CVHS and TACH. A \nrecent collaboration over three years between UVACC and CVHS successfully decreased time to \nfollow up for colorectal cancer screening. The initiative used mailed FIT tests with patient \nnavigation to UVA Colonoscopy and increased both the number screened and the timeliness of \nfollow up for individuals with positive FITs.

To decrease disparities in cancer morbidity and mortality it is essential \nto address the need for increased cancer screenings and earlier detection of treatable cancers, \nwhile increasing access to comprehensive follow up care.

CRC screening rates and outcomes can be improved by facilitating access to and \ncompletion of stool-based screening tests (e.g., FIT tests) and removing barriers to diagnostic \ncolonoscopies following an abnormal stool result. Breast cancer screening can be increased by \naddressing the needs of enhanced navigation to affordable and accessible mammography services \noften unavailable because of financial and transportation barriers.   \n  \n     Both health centers serve significant rural patient populations that need more access to cancer \nscreening.

Table 4 displays the screening \nrates by site, race, ethnicity, and insurance status. The CRC screening rate at CVHS project sites \nis less than 50 percent (49.4%) and ranges from 41.9% at the Buckingham clinic to 58.9% at the \nSouthern Albemarle clinic. There is a particular need for intervention for the uninsured \nageeligible patients (36.6% screening rate compared with 51.4% of insured patients).  Across all \nproject sites at CVHS the return rate of FIT tests in 2021 was 65%, with a rate as low as 33% at \nthe Peterson clinic. The recent collaboration between CVHS and UVACC to mail FIT tests to \nage-eligible patients resulted in an increase in the number of tests utilized; however, a primary \nbarrier to lack of FIT test completion is the challenge of providing sufficient individualized \npatient follow up, including reminders and barrier removal. The completion rates could be \nimproved through navigation that leverages existing strong community partnerships and trust in \nCVHS.  \n  \n     The CRC screening rate at TACH is 41% (2021), which represents a slight decrease compared \nto prior years. There is a considerable opportunity to increase CRC screening by introducing \nstool-based screening. Currently, TACH relies solely on colonoscopy for screenings, which is \nhampered by financial and transportation barriers, and the limited number of available \nappointments for colonoscopy for uninsured patients in the region due to a lack of GI providers \nin the region. Because colonoscopy is the gold-standard and because of concern about cultural \nnorms related to toileting, TACH medical providers have historically opted not to promote \nstoolbased screening. However, with the recent hiring of several new medical providers and a \nnew Medical Director, TACH is exploring how best to shift to stool-based screening. The \nproposed AxCS project allows TACH to benefit from CVHS’s experience and UVACC’s \nexpertise.  \n  \nTable 4.

The mortality rates of 8 in the CVHS service area \nand 13 in the TACH service area are below the VA and US rates, which are both approximately \n20.

The \nbreast cancer screening rate among CVHS project sites is 47% and ranges from 35% at CVHS \nBuckingham to 60% at CVHS Peterson. CVHS and TACH both serve as the safety net systems \nfor the uninsured, a population with limited resources and many barriers to screening. The \nBuckingham clinic serves many uninsured, and not only those who reside in the county. When \npossible, CVHS’ Fredericksburg clinic refers women to Buckingham for breast screenings, since \nthat clinic has a mammography unit and with results are read by UVA Radiology. The largest \nnumber of CVHS uninsured are seen at the Fredericksburg clinic; most are undocumented.

Barriers to maximizing equitable access to cancer screening and referral for care and \ntreatment in the service area   \n  \n     CVHS and TACH clinics experience workforce, care coordination, and community \neducation barriers to maximizing equitable access to cancer screening and referral to care:      \nThere is a significant need to address inequitable access to cancer screening and referral to care. \nSignificant barriers exist for both CVHS and TACH to maximize equitable access. A committed \nworkforce at CVHS and TACH is made of members of the mostly rural communities that these \nclinics serve. Despite the staff and organizational dedication to the health care needs of patients, \nthere is limited workforce to provide cancer screening navigation. A screening Navigator could \nprovide patient-level navigation that removes access barriers to CRC and breast cancer \nscreening. In addition, the Navigator would be able to conduct the robust and communityoriented \nfollow up that is necessary when providing comprehensive care to medically underserved \ncommunities.    \n  \nCare coordination and integration: Both CVHS and TACH have care coordination staff who \norganize patient care activities and share information among all clinical staff who are responsible \nfor a patient’s care. The goal is integrated, value-based care that is safer and more effective \nacross services. Care coordination at the health centers would benefit by using the systematic \nidentification of patients who are overdue for screenings through EHR flags and chart scrubbing \nby clinical staff. Coordinators also would assist with the screening pathway (drafting orders, \ngiving FIT test, helping with patient education). A well-organized cancer screening patient \nnavigation pathway, that also takes advantage of health IT resources, could alleviate inconsistent \nscreening, sole burden on the provider, and necessary supports. Screening follow up now is \nhampered by lack of access to specialist providers who will perform colonoscopies for uninsured \npatients. There are few available “slots,” a long wait to appointments, and a difficult process for \nregistration of patients who need financial assistance to cover the cost of follow up care."}, {"page": 9, "paragraph": 1, "text": "9  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nCommunity outreach and education: Both health centers and their clinics support community \noutreach to the extent possible, given the demands of providing primary health services. \nImproved awareness among community members about screening guidelines and the importance \nof timely screening is needed throughout the service areas. Community members need trusted \nsources of accurate information, for example from community Navigators, that is accessible both \nin terms of literacy and culture.  \n  \nAssistance with enrollment in affordable health insurance: CVHS and TACH have enrollment \ncounselors to assist the public with applying for insurance enrollment through Virginia Medicaid \nor the Federal Marketplace. CVHS has four and TACH has six of these staff members, who are \nregularly trained and certified. Patients are evaluated at the clinics, and if they are uninsured, \nthey are referred to an enrollment counselor upon registration. These staff work with individuals \nin-person, by phone, and/or virtually. In 2019 CVHS acquired Point Care tracking software that \nallows counselors to screen applicants for all available sources for which they are eligible. The \nsoftware supports tracking of assistance activities and follow up, reporting, connects to Virginia \nMedicaid for status of applications, and allows for reminder communications about renewals.  \nCVHS will share with TACH its procedures for working with Point Care and lessons learned.   \n  \nRural location of clinics and Communities without Internet/Technology Infrastructure: Over half \nof CVHS counties are rural and virtually all TACH patients reside in rural areas. Most of these \ncounties are designated health provider shortage areas and have very limited broadband access. \nMany low-income patients cannot afford internet service or data plans; older adults may not have \nor use computers or smartphones. Lack of internet connectivity is a barrier to the use of health \nIT. CVHS staff have difficulties with deploying telehealth and other technology tools in \nBuckingham, Charlotte, and Prince Edward clinics, south of Charlottesville. These factors mean \nthat health center patients are adversely affected by social determinants of health (SDOH).  \n  \n3. Health-related social needs of health center patients in the service area that affect \nequitable access to cancer screening and referral for care and treatment  \n  \n     Distance to care, lack of transportation and its cost compounds barriers to cancer screening: \nBoth CVHS and TACH patients experience barriers to obtaining needed care due to \ntransportation. Travel times to receive cancer screening and follow up care are significant for \nrural patients. For CVHS those who need colonoscopies may need to travel 1 ½ to 2 hours, and \nat TACH travel time to get to cancer centers in southwest Virginia can be 1 ½ hours, up to 3 \nhours. At CVHS, while there is a mammography unit at the Buckingham site, patients can live as \nfar away as 2 hours from that site, may not own a car, and may not be able to afford to pay for \ntransportation. There is very limited public transportation available in the Virginia communities \nserved by this project – usually none in rural areas. The exception is public transport in the two \nsmall cities CVHS serves, which represents only three of the project's 12 clinical performance \nsites. The rapidly increasing cost of gas now add significant cost, given the low median incomes \nof communities served by the project’s site (see Financial Strain below)."}, {"page": 10, "paragraph": 1, "text": "10  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \n     Language access challenges: One of CVHS city sites has the Health Center’s largest \nuninsured population, largely due to the high population of immigrants in the region. CVHS \nensures access to care through translation services, and almost all staff in that clinic  \n(Fredericksburg) are bi-lingual (Spanish). There also is a care coordinator dedicated to assist the \nsite’s patients. TACH has a lower number of non-English speakers in its population; however, the \ntranslation service is offered when needed.  \n  \n     Cultural barriers (health literacy): Health literacy can be a barrier for patients. Both Health \nCenters consider how to improve this barrier in their Quality plans. There has long been a strong \nemphasis on health education for FQHCs, a shared responsibility of all clinicians, nurses, and \nother staff. Adding dedicated Patient Navigators for the project’s target population will help to \naddress this barrier, along with the training for the clinics by partner UVACCC. According to its \n2019 needs assessment, 43% of residents in the CVHS service area and 46% of residents in the \nTACH service area report low health literacy.  \n   \n     Housing insecurity: Recent data on Housing Problems from the 2022 County Health  \nRankings for the seven localities of the eight CVHS clinics ranges from 20% of population in \nFredericksburg, 19% in Charlottesville, to a low of 11% for Louisa (rural). As rents increase with \ninflation, these statistics could worsen during this project period. The 2021 County Health \nRankings cite severe housing cost burden average for the TACH service area is 9.6%, with a cost \nburden ranging from a low of 8% in Grayson and Patrick Counties to a high of 12% in Floyd \nCounty. The Virginia average is 12%.  \n  \n     Food insecurity: In 2019, the UVACC needs assessment found that 22% of households in the \nCVHS and 24% of households in the TACH service area report experiencing food insecurity.   \nMore recently, 2022 County Health Rankings include a Food Environment Index. For six of \nCVHS communities, the index numbers are around 8-9%, with the highest (8.9%) for Louisa, \nand lowest (6.4%) for Charlotte. Rural Charlotte is a largely agricultural county.  \n  \n     Financial strain: Recently reported median incomes (County Rankings) confirm that \nindividuals served by the Health Center clinics experience financial challenges, likely affecting \ntheir ability to get cancer screenings and especially, follow up if a screening is positive. Incomes \nfor the CVHS communities range from a low of $17,255 in Prince Edward to a high of $40,198 \nin Albemarle. Household incomes for the other five communities hover from $25,000 to just over \n$34,000. For the TACH service area, the average median household income is $51,320 and \nranges from the lowest in Grayson County at $45,900 to the highest in Franklin County at \n$61,700. The state average is $79,200.   \n     In terms of unemployment, the latest Rankings report lower percentages in CVHS \ncommunities. The highest at 7.4% is for Buckingham, and the lowest is 5.4% for Albemarle \nCounty. For the TACH service area, the unemployment average is 6.3%, just above the Virginia \nrate of 6.2%. TACH had a low of 5.1% in Floyd County and a high of 8.2% in Carroll County.  \n  \n     Other Social Determinants of Health (SDOH): The Health Centers use the PRAPARE \nquestionnaire, which is integrated with their EHR, to identify barriers their patients experience \nrelated to SDOH. CVHS’ Director of Clinical Operations manages the SDOH activities for the"}, {"page": 11, "paragraph": 1, "text": "11  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nHealth Center, and supervises a team of 14 care coordinators, who use these data tools in their \nwork with patients. One staff member at each clinic has been trained and serves as the SDOH \nresource for providers. The other SDOH resource tools that aid with overcoming barriers patients \nmay encounter are FindHelp.com (previously branded as Aunt Bertha). It is an online system that \nsupports referrals to local social service resources (food, legal, childcare, housing). UniteVA is a \nsimilar resource system overseen by the Virginia Department of Health that CHC staff use. The \nPatient Navigators will be trained in using these online resources for this project.  \n  \n4. Changes in cancer screening, including UDS data, and changes in referral for care and \ntreatment in the service area between 2019 and 2021 that may be attributed to the \nCOVID19 pandemic.    \n     The COVID-19 pandemic put a strain on community health center services throughout \nVirginia and the US. The pandemic impacted mammograms and the ability to get patients their \nmammograms while at the clinic, since clinicians often focused on vaccination instead. Also, \nthere has been a requirement to delayed mammograms to 6 weeks post COVID-vaccine to get \ninto to be screened. As Table 8 below shows, at CVHS the CRC screening rate dropped 4% from \n2019 to 2021, and the breast cancer screening rate dropped 4%, as of 2021. At TACH CRC \nscreening rate has dropped gradually, from 45.9 in 2019, to 44.9 in 2020, to 41% in 2021. The \nbreast cancer screening rate at TACH dropped 3% as of 2021.   \n  \nTable 8.

One of the most significant impacts of COVID-19 on CVHS \nrelated to workforce challenges. Turnover of nurse practitioners and the loss of a physician \nassistant created staffing shortages and challenges as clinicians were often replaced by less \nexperienced providers. Most sites remain short-staffed, which combined with the impact of \nCOVID-19 exposures, further strains CVHS resources. Cancer screening, along with other \npreventive services, suffered due to these COVID-related workforce impacts.  \n     TACH also saw a decrease in patient volume during 2020, but it increased in 2021. TACH did \nnot experience the same workforce shortages as CVHS, but the COVID protocols put in place to \nprotect patients and staff led to a reprioritization of efforts and many patients were seen by \ntelehealth instead of in person, and screening that would have taken place in person was skipped \nin many telehealth appointments.  \n     During the COVID-19 Pandemic local hospitals suspended all non-elective surgeries and \nprocedures, including health maintenance screenings. Thus, it was hard to get a preventative \nscreening scheduled. There was also fear on the patient’s side of being exposed to COVID, so \nthey were reluctant to keep scheduled appointments. The hospital restrictions were lifted in early \n2022 as things moved back to normal in the region. Referral sites where patients of both CVHS \nand TACH normally complete their follow up care also have experienced workforce shortages"}, {"page": 12, "paragraph": 1, "text": "12  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nexacerbated by COVID-19. For example, the wait time for a colonoscopy appointment \npreviously was 6 months but has since increased to a year wait to get patients in for care. \nAlthough capacity has increased since the height of the pandemic, wait times remain a \nsignificant access barrier.  \n  \nRESPONSE  \n  \n1. Describe how AxCS-supported activities, as outlined in the Workplan, will increase \ncancer screening and referral for care and treatment: The detailed Project Work Plan that \noutlines activities, focus areas, timeframes, anticipated outcomes, and staff responsible is \nincluded in this application at Attachment 1.  \n  \na) Address unmet needs or barriers in achieving the increases in cancer screening and \nreferral for care and treatment   \n     The unmet needs and barriers that patients of the Health Centers encounter are fully detailed \nthroughout this section of the application, and in the following sections that cover collaboration \nand resources/capabilities. CVHS is uniquely poised to address our patients’ cancer screening \nand follow up needs while collaborating with one of our neighboring CHCs, TACH. Although \nthe organizations have differences in patient populations, ultimately, both rural-serving centers \nhave similar needs and barriers that must be addressed to increase cancer screening and follow \nup within our rural service areas.  Together, with leadership from UVACC, we will launch the \nVirginia Community Health Center Cancer Screening Collaborative, to improve cancer \nscreening and follow up by utilizing evidence-based approaches and sharing best practices. As is \nevident when reviewing the CVHS and TACH data, many needs are common across health \ncenters and solutions can be adapted to each without the need to recreate new solutions. UVACC \nis committed to providing leadership and resources to the collaborative and has buy-in from at \nleast three other CHCs, with support from our state-level colorectal cancer roundtable, to join the \nCollaborative, so the project can have a significant impact on cancer burden in Virginia. Through \nthis Collaborative, CVHS, TACH, and UVACC will improve cancer screening rates within our \npatient population and increase the number of patients assisted with accessing appropriate follow \nup care within 30 days. These objectives will be achieved by developing and integrating \ncomprehensive navigation from the community to the point of diagnosis.  To accomplish \nincreased screening and follow up, we will work to:  \n  \nEnhance the use of and standardize processes for stool-based colorectal cancer screening  \n(and increase access to screening mammograms for breast cancer – as fully described below)     \nCurrently CRC screening is underutilized at CVHS and TACH despite strong evidence that \nregular screening can reduce cancer mortality. By enhancing utilization and standardizing \nprocesses for stool-based colorectal cancer screening, we anticipate an increase in uptake of CRC \nscreening in the patient populations. Given the limited access to Gastrointestinal physicians in \nthe service areas, stool-based testing will help maximize spaces available for colonoscopy by \nreferring only positive FIT patients to colonoscopy. Currently, TACH relies solely on \ncolonoscopy, and access is hampered by financial and transportation barriers and a limited \nnumber of available slots for uninsured patients in the region. By moving to using FIT, \ncolonoscopy slots can be prioritized for patients with positive FITs. Although CVHS does use"}, {"page": 13, "paragraph": 1, "text": "13  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nstool-based tests now, completion and return of those tests remains lower than quality care \nobjectives adopted by its clinical team. Navigation of positive FITs for both health centers will \nbe key to increasing return rates of FIT tests and ultimately, increasing CRC screening. To \nenhance the use and standard processes for stool-based CRC screening we propose:  \n  \nProcess Mapping: UVACC’s COE team will work with each center’s quality improvement (QI) \nteams to complete process mapping to better understand the current state for FIT test distribution \nin CVHS clinics and how systems can be improved for the use of FITs. Likewise, process \nmapping at TACH will show how the current screening and colonoscopy referral process can be \nchanged to maximize use of FITs. Because FITs will be newly introduced into TACH’s \nworkflow, additional efforts will go into CRC screening process mapping, including selection of \nthe appropriate FIT test and processing laboratory. At both centers, process improvements may \ninclude nurse-led orders for FITs, EHR flags, and prepared labelling of kits for distribution. \nWorking with the Health Centers’ QI staff, UVACC COE will undertake process mapping for \nbreast cancer screening to introduce workflow improvements within those systems, using data \nsystem tools, navigation, and partner relationships (explained under section b) below).  \n  \nOptimizing Population Health Tools: Optimization using Population Health Tools (including i2i) \nwill be included in QI activities for breast and colon cancer screenings. Both CVHS and TACH \nuse E-clinical Works as their EHR and will use the same flagging system within that data \nmanagement system to alert providers of patients who are not up to date with their CRC \nscreening. For community members who are not yet patients, a different navigation system will \nbe set up to create a list for targeted outreach, to raise awareness about the importance of \nscreening, options for screening and how to schedule a clinic appointment. The health center \nNavigators will use this list, developed through the population health tool (i2i) to implement a \nnew protocol for communication and navigation for these individuals.   \n  \nWorkforce Training: As is documented in the literature, a strong provider recommendation can \nincrease uptake of FIT testing. UVACC has piloted education with primary care providers (PCPs) \nat UVA Health and as a result, FIT orders have increased. Education sessions cover topics such \nas options for screening, efficacy of CRC screening by test type, current screening rates, and best \npractices to improve rates. UVACC will adapt these successful provider education trainings and \ndeliver them to providers at both health centers.  \n  \nCRC Navigation: A 2018-21 pilot between CVHS and UVACC to mail FIT tests to age-eligible \npatients resulted in an increase in the number of completed FITs. However, a primary barrier to \ntest completion was sufficient individualized patient follow up, including reminders and help \nwith removing barriers (i.e., transportation, financial assistance). These issues will be addressed \nthrough navigation that leverages existing strong community partnerships and trust in the health \ncenters. Both TACH and CVHS will hire Patient Navigators dedicated to this project to \ncoordinate all aspects of navigation related to CRC screening. A UVACC Navigator will work \nwith the health center Navigators and other center staff to develop a standard navigation protocol \nfor patients receiving a FIT test from the clinics. The newly developed process map and feedback \nfrom community listening sessions will inform the protocol and address common barriers \npreventing completion. Also, UVACC will provide training on best practices in navigation and"}, {"page": 14, "paragraph": 1, "text": "14  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nassist in the role of navigation services and documentation. The UVACC Navigator will work \nwith CVHS and TACH Navigators to adapt newly developed protocols to provide similar \nnavigation services for mailed FITs.   \n  \nMailed FIT Campaign: To address current barriers faced by the health centers to get patients \nscreened, including transportation issues, lack of access, and low health literacy, a large-scale \nmailed FIT campaign with embedded systematic processes and navigation will be conducted at \nCVHS. Mailed FITs are a proven, cost-effective way to increasing CRC screening rates and can \naddress health disparities faced by rural community members. Launching this mailed FIT \ncampaign will decrease the burden on the CVHS providers, who are pressured to address \ncompeting health needs during short in-clinic visits. The return rate from CVHS’ recent pilot was \nlow partly due to the lack of standardized, evidence-based communication and navigation. The \nUVACC COE team and Navigator will adapt best practices from the Mailed FIT Implementation \nGuide from the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors and CDC to establish a \nprogram that connects with a broad, hard to reach population, to yield a higher return of FITs. \nUsing CVHS’ population health data management system, patients will be identified who are \nage-eligible (45+), overdue for colorectal cancer screening, and do not have an upcoming in \nclinic appointment. The data management system will be built to track these patients through \neach step of the mailed FIT campaign. The campaign will have key steps such as mailing out a \nprimer letter to eligible patients, sending a high-quality FIT that is pre-labeled for return to the \nlab, mailing a reminder, making phone calls to non-completers, and navigation by the health \ncenter Navigator for patients with abnormal results. CVHS will develop a process that can be \nsustained and conducted annually. Once these protocols are in place, they will be adapted for \nimplementation at TACH. CVHS Navigators and other health center staff will work with TACH \nto establish best practices and share lessons learned. TACH will provide a similar mailed FIT \ncampaign for patients in their service area. Through the mailed FIT campaigns, completion of \nCRC screening is expected to increase significantly in rural populations at both centers who \nwould not be seen in clinics for screening assessments.  \n  \nImprove access to screening mammograms for breast cancer   \n     Uninsured rural women face multiple barriers in receiving a screening mammogram. Travel \ndistance and commute time to get to screening sites are exacerbated by the absence of public \ntransportation options, decreasing the likelihood that women will complete their recommended \nbreast cancer screenings. Health centers, such as TACH and CVHS, with strong community \nconnections can play a vital role in reducing disparities related to transportation and access by \nproviding mammography closer to where their patients live and reducing financial burden \nassociated with completing screening. To improve access to screening mammograms we \npropose:  \n  \nOptimizing EHR and Population Health Tools: To enhance the use of supportive technology, both \nCVHS and TACH will optimize their EHR and population health tools. Best practice indicates \nthat the addition of patient flags within the EHR can increase the likelihood that healthcare \nproviders discuss and order appropriate screening tests. They will work together to leverage \nCVHS’s experience use the data tools. In addition to EHR flags to help for in-clinic visits, the \ncenters will together develop processes for easily identifying screening-eligible women over 40"}, {"page": 15, "paragraph": 1, "text": "15  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nwho are overdue for breast cancer screening. CVHS recently integrated an advanced version of \nthe i2i tool for identification and reporting. TACH will work with CVHS to adapt processes \nwithin their EHR using a different version of i2i to generate a list of their patients who are due \nfor screening. These lists will be routed to the health center Navigators. The Navigators will \ndevelop a protocol to connect these patients with the appropriate site for mammography.   \n  \nNavigation for Breast Screening: As improvements are made to the EHR system and established \nreferral pathways, there will be another need to help overdue women navigate to the correct \npathway to complete their breast cancer screening. To address this, the TACH and CVHS \nNavigators will help in all aspects of navigation related to breast cancer screening. The UVACC \nNavigator will collaborate with the health center Navigators and other health center staff, such as \nthe referral teams, to develop a standard navigation protocol for patients who need \nmammography - whether from within the Center, from mobile mammography, Every Woman’s \nLife, or a regional provider referral site. Additionally, UVACC will provide training on best \npractices in navigation and assist in the roll-out of navigation services and documentation.   \n  \nMobile Mammography: Accessing mammography is a top need to for breast cancer screening \nbecause of the geographic location of services and insufficient transportation to screening sites. \nAlthough CVHS has a mammography unit at its Buckingham clinic, women from other CVHS \nsites must travel up to two hours to be screened there. TACH does not have a mammography \nunit, so must refer all women off-site for screening. The closest sites to TACH for mammograms \nare through Ballad Health and Carilion, located over an hour away for most TACH patients. \nGiven the distance to screening mammography, UVACC proposes to establish routine visits from \nthe UVA Mobile Prevention Coach.  The mobile coach will bring comprehensive breast \nscreening closer to home for women seen at the rural clinics. The self-contained coach uses the \nlatest technology, including 3D imaging. It has the capacity to perform up to 25 exams in one \nday. UVACC will work with the health centers to develop a rotating schedule for the coach to \nvisit, also deploying the EHR/i2i system to identify and schedule women to the mobile coach.  \nWomen who are provided mammography by the mobile coach will receive navigation services \nfrom the UVA Navigator in coordination with the Navigators at the health centers.  \n  \nEvery Woman’s Life: In addition to bringing improved access through the mobile coach, TACH \nand CVHS will become referral sites for Every Woman’s Life (EWL), which helps uninsured, \nlow-income women gain access to free breast cancer screening services. For TACH, EWL is \navailable at Carilion Clinic and through local health districts including Mount Rogers, New \nRiver Valley, and West Piedmont. Women from CVHS will be referred for enrollment to the \nUVACC EWL program. Women seen on the mobile coach at the clinics will be screened for \neligibility for EWL by UVA. For women unable to be seen on the mobile coach, who get a \nscreening appointment with another provider, the health centers will provide financial assistance \nto reduce the debt burden, through a new FindHealth.com partnership with Uber (CVHS \nsubscription with the SDOH tool used by CHCs) or with gas cards provided to the patient or \ncaregiver. These cards will be managed by the Navigator, who will work with women to navigate \nto the mammography site that best fits their needs. UVACC will train health center Navigators in \nthe EWL program to assure best practices for enrollment and follow up are consistent across \nsites."}, {"page": 16, "paragraph": 1, "text": "16  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \n  \nImplement clear and accessible pathways for breast and colorectal cancer referrals and \nfollow up    \n     Many patients from health centers face long wait times due to a limited appointment spots and \ncomplex referral systems. Although the need for streamlined access is more prevalent for \ncolorectal cancer because of the limited number of Gastrointestinal providers in rural areas, \nsimilar needs exist for breast cancer screening follow up. To address this barrier, we propose the \nfollowing activities:  \n  \nStreamlined and Expanded Referral Pathways: Developing a relationship between health centers \nand referral practice sites is critical to the provision of timely, quality care. Establishing a trusted \nrelationship will result in improved communication, smooth patient handoffs, and efficient \nturnaround and documentation of screening results. Improved quality of care has been \ndemonstrated through CVHS’ established relationship with UVA Health’s Breast Center. Referral \nstaff have a smooth referral process due to this relationship with staff at UVA Health’s Breast \nCenter. Better communication has resulted between CVHS and UVA, with faster follow up \ntimes, and ease of accessing findings.   \n  \nTo mirror the connection CVHS has with UVA Health, UVACC will work with CVHS and  \nTACH referral staff, outreach coordinators, and patient Navigators to identify providers for both \nbreast and colorectal services. Activities will include current referral sites and potential new \nsites. A list of providers will be created with relevant information on each service provider \nincluding payment and insurance types accepted, location, transportation options, and services \noffered. UVACC will assist each health center’s referral team in establishing a point of contact at \neach provider practice if one does not already exist. Together, the health center and key contacts \nwill work to streamline the process for making referrals at established sites. When possible, a \nsingle contact point will be identified. And, using the referral sites list, the health centers will \nconnect with potential new sites to introduce referral processes. By enhancing the referral \nprocess and expanding the number of referral sites, CVHS and TACH expect to see an increase \nin patients seen for follow up in a timely manner, and a decrease in wait times.  \n  \nReserved Appointment Slots: There are long wait times for appointments for the uninsured at \nboth health centers. Health center referral staff work diligently to schedule follow ups for breast \nand colorectal cancer, but available appointments often are over a year away. This barrier is \nexacerbated for the uninsured due to limited options for follow up. Many referral sites do not \nhave extensive charity care or easy-to-navigate financial aid programs. To address the barriers, \nthe health centers will work with UVACC to negotiate reserved appointments for uninsured \npatients at UVA Health and other health systems. In the CRC Fit to Colonoscopy pilot between \nCVHS and UVACC, patients entering UVA Health through the pilot were seen within three \nmonths compared to the traditional 6-12 month wait. Through this new collaboration to \naccelerate cancer screenings, the process developed under the pilot will be maintained and \nexpanded to patients coming from TACH. UVACC and health center staff will attempt to \nestablish similar processes at other health systems, especially those closer to TACH patients. \nUVACC will take the best practices applied to CRC and work within its Breast Center to \nestablish the same standard, and work to get patients seen for follow up within the 30-day"}, {"page": 17, "paragraph": 1, "text": "17  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nwindow. As this process expands at UVA Health, UVACC also will begin to use its extensive \nnetworks to connect with hospital systems in TACH and CVHS’s service areas to negotiate \nreserved appointment slots for patients need follow up care from these two centers. This will \nallow for increased and timely access to both breast and colorectal cancer follow up.  \n  \nIncrease financial assistance for breast and colorectal cancer screening and follow up       \nStrides have been made at the national level to eliminate gaps in coverage for breast and \ncolorectal cancer screening follow up. In 2022, the gap for privately insured patients needing a \ncolonoscopy after a positive FIT was closed when the Tri-Agencies finalized its coverage rule, \nrequiring private insurance companies to cover follow up colonoscopies. Despite this positive \nchange for one group of patients, there remains a barrier for patients who are on traditional \nMedicaid and Medicare plans or are uninsured. They are left with significant costs associated \nwith colonoscopy. There are similar financial barriers for CHC patients related to breast cancer \nscreening. These costs often deter patients from completing their screening, leaving some of the \nmost vulnerable patients at greatest risk of late-stage diagnosis for breast and colorectal cancer. \nTo address these barriers and financial gaps we will implement the following strategies.  \n  \nEvery Woman’s Life Program: As stated above, EWL can help close breast screening and follow \nup financial gaps for uninsured women. The statewide program can enroll patients and connect \nthem to a EWL site where they can not only receive a free mammogram, but also receive free \ndiagnostic care as needed. Women enrolled in EWL are eligible for Medicaid if a cancer \ntreatment is needed through the Virginia Medicaid Breast & Cervical Cancer Prevention and \nTreatment Act.  \n  \nTransportation Assistance: Transportation is a well-documented barrier to completion of cancer \nfollow up care. Given the rurality of both health center’s service areas, public transportation is \nvirtually nonexistent. As described above, this project will provide gas cards for patients’ use to \nget to and from appointments at referral sites for diagnostic breast cancer services or for \ncolonoscopies. Another solution newly available is for CVHS to pay for the transportation costs \nthrough its subscription with the FindHelp.com SDOH tool. Removing this barrier has a role as \npart of a multi-component intervention to increase screening and follow up. Gas cards and \ntransportation cost coverage will be assigned based on needs identified through the patient \nnavigation protocol. The health center Navigators will document both within the patient \nmanagement system.  \n  \nFunds to offset follow up expenses: The rate of completed follow up colonoscopy after a positive \nFIT is often low, as is evident in the pilot data presented above. Although there are many barriers \nto completion of a follow up colonoscopy, patients often face barriers related to the unexpected \ncosts associated with the colonoscopy. To address this barrier, we will work with our UVACC \npartners to expand the option of a flat rate colonoscopy rate beyond UVA Health. The current \nrate is $1029, which includes all expenses, including the physician, labs, and pathology. This low \nrate allows CVHS to cover the costs for more uninsured patients who require follow up. Working \nwith UVACC, which has extensive relationships with health systems across Virginia, the health \ncenters will work toward implementing this flat rate model at other health systems in our service \nareas. When the new flat rate is established, TACH and CVHS will cover the costs of the follow"}, {"page": 18, "paragraph": 1, "text": "18  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nup colonoscopies for those who have no other financial means to have this procedure covered \n(in-kind). CVHS and TACH will work with UVACC to take the best practices for the reduced, \nflat fee from colorectal cancer and apply them within the UVA Breast Center (and other health \nsystems) so that follow up care will be less burdensome on the patients.  \n  \nTraining on Financial Assistance/Charity Programs: Streamlining and training the CVHS and \nTACH outreach staff on the financial assistance programs at local hospitals will take place.  \nCVHS and TACH have dedicated staff to help patients with their financial assistance needs. \nOutreach staff help them complete Medicaid paperwork and apply for financial assistance in \nvarious systems of care. However, the assistance application for each hospital that patients visit \ndiffers and is complicated for health center staff and patients. To overcome the challenges, UVA \noutreach specialists will work with outreach staff at CVHS and TACH to connect with local \nhospital financial assistance teams to train on their systems. After understanding the basics of \nthese assistance programs, the UVA outreach specialist, health center enrollment staff, and the \nhospital teams will standardize paperwork required for applications. Process improvements will \nhelp patients with low-literacy, or who may be more transient, to complete necessary documents. \nTACH referrals for treatment are to the nearest hospital to the TACH clinic. For patients who are \nuninsured and/or low-income, the best options are Ballad Health and Carilion Clinic because \nthey are nonprofit hospital systems, and thus have charity care programs.  \n  \nb) Enhance or expand strategies, including the use of enabling services, to improve the \npatient experience   \n     CVHS and TACH have long-standing ties to the communities they serve, contributing to an \noverall positive patient experience. Both health centers proactively contribute to the well-being \nof patients by being patient-centered, welcoming, and team-oriented. Over years CVHS has \nadded enabling services and staff who are responsible for outreach, enrollment, health education, \nand raising awareness in the community. CVHS participates in health fairs, presents at \ncommunity events throughout central Virginia with screenings and education, provides \ninformational materials, including a presence on social media and newspaper articles, and offers \nproviders who speak to community groups. At its Fredericksburg clinic, the Spanish-speaking \nproviders and staff present at churches, civic groups. This team has a long relationship with the \ncity’s nonprofit that serves the homeless and immigrants. Likewise, TACH has been doing \noutreach to Hispanic communities, especially Spanish-only speakers, by sponsoring health \nscreening and legal information fairs, as well as leading and participating in food, clothing, and \nshoe drives for children, older adults, and others in need. UVACC will enhance the already \nexisting patient experience at both health centers by amplifying community capacity and \nbidirectional partnerships through its OCOE.  \n  \nCommunity Participation Sessions: Before initiating the strategies to address the needs within the \ntwo health centers, UVACC will deploy its rural-focused outreach specialist to conduct listening \nand stakeholder interviews with existing CVHS and TACH community partners to identify \nspecific community needs and barriers that may impact residents’ ability to access or complete \ncancer screenings. The findings from the listening sessions will inform development of further \noutreach activities and will help to personalize and adapt navigation pathways at both centers."}, {"page": 19, "paragraph": 1, "text": "19  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nPatient Education and Awareness: UVACC outreach specialists will work with community \nchampions and the health centers’ existing networks to provide Understanding Cancer, UVACC’s \nevidence-based community cancer education program, at local faith-based organizations, civic \ngroups, public libraries, worksites and for other interested groups.  \nUnderstanding Cancer covers the basics of cancer from its etiology, risk reduction, and screening \nguidelines, including breast and colorectal.  In addition, the community champions and CHWs \nwill undergo the facilitator training to be able to provide their own workshops within their \ncommunity networks.    \n  \nTo increase referrals from the community into the health centers, a cancer screening guidelines \nchecklist will be developed and implemented as part of the Understanding Cancer workshop. As \ncommunity members complete UC, the facilitators will have participants complete the cancer \nscreening guidelines checklist to identify if they are up to date with their own cancer screenings. \nFor those who are not up to date with cancer screening for breast or colorectal cancers, the \nUVACC Navigator will connect with the participant and help navigate them into the closest \nhealth center to either establish care or schedule an appointment to meet with a care provider to \ndiscuss screening options.   \n  \nIn addition to the Understanding Cancer workshops, UVACC outreach specialists will help the \nhealth centers adapt their patient education tools for a low-literacy level and translate materials in \nSpanish for growing non-English speaking populations. These education tools will be available \nin the clinics and given to the CHW and community champions to share at community events.  \n  \nc) Promote equity in access to cancer screening and referral for patients, special \npopulations, and other residents of the health centers’ service area  \n     While cancer mortality has slowed across much of the U.S., cancer mortality decreases in \nrural areas continue to lag. With over 50% of CVHS’, and all of TACH’s, service area being \nrural, many of their patients face disparities related to cancer screening. Rural residents are \nfacing inequities at all levels from patient, provider, community, state, and national level that \nresult in consistently low screening and early-stage diagnosis, resulting in higher cancer \nmortality. Through this project CVHS and TACH will work with UVACC to implement \nstrategies proven effective for increasing breast and colorectal cancer screening in rural \ncommunities. Leveraging the UVA team’s extensive expertise in multi-level screening \ninterventions for rural communities, CVHS and TACH will implement comprehensive \nnavigation strategies to remove barriers typical of rural communities.  \n  \n     The various activities and strategies this collaborative project will implement to remove \ninequities and support increased access have been described above, and in the following sections.   \nAs stated above, CVHS has relationships with social service agencies and homeless center.  \nOutreach staff of the two health centers regularly connected with public housing communities. \nUnder the Collaboration section below, there is more information about the health centers’ work \nto improve health care access for special populations.  \n  \nd) Addressing the impact of COVID-19 on cancer screening:"}, {"page": 20, "paragraph": 1, "text": "20  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \n     As both health centers continue to rebound from the lasting impacts of COVID-19, we plan to \nleverage this Collaborative to improve systems that were negatively impacted during the height \nof COVID-19 and help increase screening for breast and colorectal cancer. A significant barrier \nthat was created due to COVID-19 was a decrease in the CVHS workforce. Rural communities \nface health care provider shortages. The COVID-19 pandemic heightened this problem.       To \naddress this, CVHS will take our fragmented system for cancer screening and work toward \nefficient, streamline processes that take the workload off providers when possible. The \nintegration of automatic systems, such as EHR alerts/flags will reduce additional work on the \nprovider. Although TACH did not experience the same workforce issues, they also did not have \nthe same level of sophistication with cancer screening and referrals and therefore can learn from \nCVHS’s process enhancements. Additionally, by hiring a Navigator for each health system, \ncommunication will no longer be fragmented between the front desk, nurses, referral specialists, \nand providers. Instead, there will be one point for communication allowing clinical staff to work \nat the top of their certifications/licenses. The fact that referral sites shut down during the \npandemic resulted in an increased wait time for many of our patients to receive their follow up \ncare. To address this, we will work to re-establish or establish points of contact within the \nsystems to streamline our referral processes.   \n     We also will rely heavily on UVACC to assist with establishing standing appointment spots \nwithin our referral sites to increase our patients’ capacity to get timely follow up care, with the \ngoal of within 30-days. Finally, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we relied heavily on \nconnecting with patients outside of our health centers through telehealth and audio visits, \nbecause many patients were hesitant to come into the clinics and/or were not able to be seen in \nperson because of COVID screening protocols. As a result, CVHS established a basic mailed FIT \nprogram. Although clinic volumes are rising to a pre-pandemic level, this mailed campaign can \nstill benefit patients. CVHS plans to continue and standardize this program while assisting TACH \nin getting their mailed FIT program established.  \n  \ne) Leveraging health IT  \n     As stated above, both CVHS and TACH use e-Clinical Works as their EHR and the patient \nportal, plus Healow in communication with patients. CVHS has extensive experience with other \nprojects using telehealth to reach its patients distantly. It has used the LUMA platform and other \nvideo tools for virtual visits since 2020. Until recently, almost all BH visits at CVHS were \nprovided via telehealth, including access for rural patients into group counseling via video. \nCVHS and TACH have an established relationship to distant specialists at UVA, including \nradiology, OB-Gyn, and psychiatry. Some consults are supported through program at the UVa \nOffice of Telemedicine. In terms of HIT, TACH can pull patient data on age, sex, and diagnosis \nfor patients to bring them in for screenings. The reporting activity could also be completed as \npart of the patient’s annual physical.  \n  \n3. \nChanges in scope required to implement your AxCS project: There are no changes in \nscope required to implement this project.  \n  \n4. \nProposed Personnel (as in Budget Narrative) essential to successfully implement the \nproposed project"}, {"page": 21, "paragraph": 1, "text": "21  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nPatient Navigators (to be hired): A key component of the success of this project hinges on \nestablishing patient navigation within both CVHS and TACH. Neither center has an established \nNavigator. Instead, the centers rely on fragmented components of navigation by staff performing \nmultiple roles. With these new positions there will be seamless communication around cancer \nscreening internally with the centers’ staff and externally with patients, referral sites and \ncommunity partners. CVHS and TACH will each hire one Navigator assigned to this project. \nThey will be responsible for tracking referrals and case management. They will be the direct \ncontact with UVA and other cancer center Navigators in coordinating the referrals and follow up \ncare for all patients with abnormal mammography and FIT test findings. They also will serve as \nthe lead in the FIT Test implementation and getting the FIT tests returned in a timely manner.  \n  \nProject Director (to be hired, 0.15 FTE): CVHS will hire a Project Director who will work with  \nUVACC and help coordinate the activities of the Patient Navigators, in collaboration with the \nTACH leadership and clinical director. Randall Bashore, MD, is the Clinical Director for CVHS, \nand will serve (in-kind) as the PI for this project, as stated in the collaboration documentation. \nHe will work closely with the Project Director.   \n  \nUVA Cancer Center Program Manager (contract): This incumbent of this position will be the \nmain point of contact between CVHS and TACH and will work with the two health center \nNavigators and project director at CVHS. Also, this person will be responsible for synthesizing \navailable evidence on cancer patient navigation interventions, developing navigation pathways, \nproviding training and ongoing support to the health centers on best practices in navigation, \ncollecting and analyzing data, and performing outreach. This person will oversee deployment of \nthe UVA Cancer Center Navigators and outreach staff who will work directly with community \nmembers and patients to develop educational materials, provide lay cancer education sessions, \nand offer basic navigation to the health centers during community events.  \n  \nCOLLABORATION  \n  \n1. How project will leverage Cancer Center trained and supervised outreach specialists and \npatient navigators to improve cancer screening and referral for care and treatment \nwithin the service area   \n     UVACC will work with CVHS and TACH to develop patient navigation pathways for breast \nand colorectal cancer. UVACC will provide evidence-based best practice summaries of literature, \ncollaborate with the on-site Navigators, Medical Directors, and other personnel at each Center to \nadapt the strategies for each clinic setting. The UVA team will assist in the development of the \nimplementation protocols, provide training for clinic staff, and assist in developing tracking and \nmonitoring tools. Health center teams who are responsible for referrals care coordination, and \nquality will be part of these activities.  \n     CVHS and TACH will receive the same training from UVACC for their internal Navigators. \nFurther, UVACC has committed to continuing to provide technical assistance and other training \nsupport beyond the funding period to both CVHS and TACH as well as other health centers who \njoin the Collaborative. Also, at CVHS and TACH, associated staff such as Case Managers, \nClinical Managers, and Office Managers will receive a briefer version of the training so that they \ncan act as extenders of the Navigator."}, {"page": 22, "paragraph": 1, "text": "22  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \n     The narrative sections below (and above) fully explain how the AxCS in Rural Communities \nproject will leverage UVACC research, training, and OEO-supervised outreach specialists. Team \nmembers also will engage providers at the 12 clinic sites, who are supervised by the chief \nclinical officers. All will focus on improvement in screening and referrals in their respective \nservice areas.  \n  \n2. Describe how project will leverage the resources of UVACC (Cancer Center Partner) to:   \na) \nBuild capacity of health center staff in the areas of outreach and patient navigators \nthat will last beyond the funding period:   \n     Capacity building will be an important component of the work that the Cancer Center does \nwith the health centers. CVHS and TACH have existing relationships with UVACC and have \npartnered on cancer-related outreach and education and some basic navigation in the past. \nThrough this new collaboration, we are expanding on these existing relationships and improving \nthe capacity to address the barriers for cancer screening in our rural populations. UVACC COE is \nfounded in community-based principles, which help to develop capacity within communities to \nperform sustainable, high impact work.   \n     Instead of solely relying on UVACC to do all the outreach and navigation, both health centers \nwill instead learn and train our own staff on the best practices that they then will instill within \nour own systems and throughout the community. For example, UVACC will train health center \nstaff in their community education program, Understanding Cancer, so that both health centers \ncan have a broader reach and greater impact in our communities. Additionally, by hiring and \ntraining Navigators for the health centers, we will not need to rely heavily on the UVACC \nNavigator after we have developed and implemented our new processes and pathways for \nnavigation. We will maintain our partnership with UVACC beyond the grant period; however, \nmany of our processes and procedures will be institutionalized within our systems to allow for \nadditional growth and expansion to other types of cancer.    \n  \nb) \nFacilitate referrals of individuals in need of cancer screening, referral for care and \ntreatment, and other comprehensive primary care services to the health centers  \n     UVACC will draw upon its experience in developing referral pathways for colorectal cancer \nand adapt their best practices for breast cancer to help facilitate referrals for cancer screening and \nfollow up for the Health Centers’ patients. Additionally, UVACC will leverage its existing \nrelationships with other hospitals throughout the service areas to negotiate appointments, assist \nin setting flat rates for follow up, and develop streamlined referral processes.  \n     CVHS’ pathways are different for its sites in various geographic areas. For example, its  \nFredericksburg clinic refers patients to two health systems serving its community. For the other 7 \nCVHS clinics involved in this project, UVa Health is a key referral partner, as stated several \ntimes in this application. CVHS works with several practices that are part of UVA physician \ngroups, and through the UVA Office of Telemedicine.   \n     Under this project TACH will develop pathways within its existing referral provider network \nthrough Ballad Health and Carilion Health Systems for patients with abnormal mammogram \nfindings or a positive FIT test. These hospitals have charity care programs to assist low-income \nfamilies and uninsured for their needed follow up care. TACH has a telemedicine contract with \nthe UVA Office of Telemedicine and often can get referral appointments with specialists in \nCharlottesville quicker than a direct physician referral. The UVA charity program discounts"}, {"page": 23, "paragraph": 1, "text": "23  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nservices for qualified low-income patients or the uninsured. The UVA referrals would be the \ndefault referral when all local referral attempts are exhausted.   \n     As is noted throughout the document, the UVACC Outreach Specialists will be active in the \nCVHS and TACH service areas and will refer individuals who need screening, and may need \nreferral for care and treatment, and/or need primary care services to CVHS or TACH, as \nappropriate. In this way, the UVACC Outreach Specialists will be able to extend the reach of \nhealth center staff further into the communities served by the two health centers.  \n  \nc) Share data on relevant cancer statistics (e.g., cancer prevalence, screening rates) to \nsupport health center program planning and quality improvement  \n     UVACC already has begun to work with CVHS and TACH to provide extensive cancer \nstatistics and other relevant demographic data. The Cancer Center is committed to continuing to \nshare existing and new data to guide program development. It can access cancer registry data as \nwell as state and national databases to help the Health Centers fine-tune and guide the  \nCollaborative’s work. In return, we will be able to share Health Center patient data and outcomes \nto better understand our patient populations and implement innovative quality improvement \nstrategies.   \n     Over the years UVACC has shared relevant cancer statistics with CVHS and TACH as part of \nother project partnerships. These data have helped each health center to decide where to place \nstaff time, energy, and resources regarding cancer-related efforts and quality improvement. As \nCVHS and TACH continue to work to improve cancer screening and treatment and referral rates, \ndata provided by UVACC will help to properly target those most at need for assistance.  \n  \n3. How the project will leverage the resources of AxCS partners beyond UVACC, to:    This \nCollaborative project will take advantage of resource beyond UVACC to implement activities of \nthe Workplan. As described more fully in the Response section, these activities   have been \nplanned by the three AxCS partners to a) Address patients’ barriers to screenings and follow up; \nb) Strengthen and improve care coordination, community engagement and population health; \nand c) Share data on relevant cancer statistics in service area to support health center program \nplanning and quality improvement.   \n     Team members will engage with the following existing networks to implement the above \nlisted activities to broaden the impact of this project and build sustainability.  \n  \nCommunity Health Workers: The UVACC outreach specialist and Health Center navigators will \nwork with existing community health worker (CHW) networks, such as the WellAware program \nin Albemarle that provides rural resource connections to clients to meet them “where they are \nand get them to primary care services.” WellAware is an initiative developed by CVHS, the \nCharlottesville Free Clinic, and UVa Primary Care. CHWs, like the two who are employed by \nWellAware, live and work in the communities they serve and have established trusted \nrelationships with community members.  Through WellAware, CVHS has been able to build \nbridges to better health within their service area by enhancing patient-centered care coordination. \nCurrent CHW networks provide help to establish primary care, arrange transportation, and \naccompany community members to health appointments."}, {"page": 24, "paragraph": 1, "text": "24  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nCommunity Champions: For TACH local community champions will be identified and will \nmodel practices like WellAware. Champions for TACH will be identified by working with its \nthree local health districts, local partners, Relay for Life groups, and the Center’s Outreach \nCoordinator.  \n  \nUVA Cancer Center Without Walls: TACH is a member of the UVA CCWW Advisory Board. \nTheir focus is on prevention and early detection of cancer in far Southwest Virginia. They have \nfour primary areas of focus, including colorectal cancer screening. The CCWW has four \nworkgroups that meet monthly to discuss outreach and patient education in the service area. The \nmembers of the CCWW include the UVA Cancer Center staff, local hospital networks, CHCs, \nFree Clinics, private providers, local health departments, and other ancillary service providers as \nwell as patient support organizations, the American Cancer Society, and faith-based \norganizations. An Emory and Henry College Mass Media Class has prepared educational videos \non the importance of colorectal screening for the targeted age group. The CCWW Advisory \nBoard also provided introductions to the Ballad Cancer Center Navigators for the CCWW \nmembers. Ballad Health and Carilion Health Systems, along with UVA all have Charity Care \nPrograms that discount services to qualified patients based on their ability to pay.   \n  \nMigrant Health Network: TACH is a participating partner in this Network that is managed \nthrough a HRSA grant to Southwest Virginia Community Health Systems (SVCHS), a \nneighboring FQHC. They provide outreach to migrant and seasonal farmworkers in 8 counties in \nSouthwest Virginia. They provide transportation, translation, and interpretative services in \ncoordinating the health care of the migrant farm worker families in the area. In addition, TACH \nhas been doing additional outreach and holding events promoting health screenings, including \ncancer, to Spanish-speaking residents of the service area.  \n  \nd) Building relationships with other potential partners (i.e., VA Breast Cancer Association, \nHitting Cancer Below the Belt, American Cancer Society): CVHS and its two partners who have \nplanned this AxCS project decided to limit the number of partners participating in this funding \nopportunity. Instead, during Year 1 project leaders will explore the resources offered by statewide \nand national cancer-related groups and determine if bringing them on as partners for Year 2, or in \nthe future, is mutually beneficial.  \n  \n4. \nDocumentation of Partnership with NCI-designed Comprehensive Cancer Center: \nDetails of UVACC’s partnership for this AxCS project are described in the Commitment Letter \nsigned by the CEO of the UVACCC, as well as the contract agreement between CVHS and UVA \nprovided at Attachment 2. These documents align with the content of the application’s \nCollaboration section.   \n  \n5. \nLetter of Support from Partnering Health Center: The letter from the CEO of TACH \nat Attachment 3 defines the relationship and describes the collaboration and coordinated \nactivities in support of this project. TACH is a full partner serving as the equivalent of CVHS.  \n  \n6. \nSummary of Contracts and/or Agreements: A list of CVHS’ current contracts and \nagreements is provided at Attachment 4."}, {"page": 25, "paragraph": 1, "text": "25  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \n  \nRESOURCES/CAPABILITIES  \n  \n1. Past efforts of the two Health Centers, alone or in collaboration with other partners, to \nincrease the number and percentage of patients accessing cancer screening and referral for \ncare and treatment.   \n     Currently CVHS is a partner under Project Coalesce, a two-year cancer education and \nawareness grant-funded project initiated by the VCU Massey Cancer Center. Massey is the other \nNCI-designated cancer center in Virginia. The project is focused on increasing cancer screenings \nto tackle the very high cancer incidence in southside Virginia, by raising public awareness and \ndeveloping health education events, while engaging with community partners to execute \nactivities. CVHS project is focused on its rural Brunswick County clinic, in partnership with \nBrunswick Health Ambassadors (BHA), a community group. In addition to CVHS, three other  \nCHCs that serve different service areas (Richmond and southern Virginia) are partnering with  \nVCU Massey CC under Project Coalesce. Through Project Coalesce, during 2021 and 2022 \nCVHS and BHA have participated in health fairs; organized an event for men to raise awareness \nabout CRC and encourage screening, planned an education event for women to be held fall 2022 \n(focused on breast and cervical cancer), and are contributing a bi-weekly column on health for \nthe local Brunswick newspaper. The partners anticipate a presence at the Southside Remote-Area \nMedical (RAM) in mid-August 2022.   \n     TACH is a member of the UVA Cancer Center Without Walls and a staff member has served a \nCo-Chair for several years. As a result of this effort, TACH has partnered with others on \nadvertising and outreach efforts. A video produced by Emory and Henry College Mass Media \ncourse students only been launched recently. Its impact cannot yet be determined. In the past, the \nUVA Mobile Mammography Unit has visited some TACH clinics to provide breast screenings, \nprior to the COVID pandemic.  \n  \n2.  Capabilities and expertise of the two Health Centers to carry out the proposed project, \nincluding  \n  \nCapacity to manage the collaboration with AxCS partners to accomplish AxCS objectives:       \nCVHS has a long-standing, productive relationship with TACH. As neighboring health centers, \nthe organizations work to complement services. The CEOs of both Health Centers are in regular \ncontact, on an almost weekly basis, consulting with each other, answering questions, and \nproviding suggestions for resources. Also, senior leadership team members from each consult \nwith their counterparts. For example, CVHS has the strongest pharmacy program in Virginia and \nthe CVHS Pharmacy Director consults with the TACH Pharmacy Director. Similarly, TACH has \na very mature BH program. The CEO of TACH is a psychologist. Consequently, various CVHS \nstaff have reached out to TACH regarding BH questions.  \n     As described above, and elsewhere in this application, CVHS’ past partnership with UVACC \nfocused on cancer screenings and follow up, and its present relationship with VCU Massey CC \nhave informed this proposal. Over its 51 years, CVHS has partnered with the Virginia \nDepartment of Health (currently on a contraception program for uninsured women), with local \nhealth districts and mental health agencies, regional hospitals, state health associations, the"}, {"page": 26, "paragraph": 1, "text": "26  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nVirginia Health Care Foundation, and several private foundations to create and implement \ncommunity-level public health initiatives.  \n  \nOrganizational systems of the two Health Centers for tracking and closing referral loops:      \nThere is a staff of 14 on the referral team for CVHS, based at the Buckingham site. All are \ntrained to support the clinical team who need to refer their patients for services outside of the \nHealth Center. One is dedicated to Fredericksburg, an equity response due to the high volume of \nuninsured who need primary care in that area. In addition to CVHS Referral director, there is a \nteam leader who does most of the tracking and reporting. For TACH, in addition to having \nclinical staff at each clinic assigned to tracking and closing referral loops, the organization has \ntwo full-time Referral Coordinators, one of whom works on the referral side while the other \nworks on getting the reports from referrals into the patient records.  \n  \nSkills and experience of the proposed project personnel:   \n     The personnel proposed for funding under this project have not yet been hired. Therefore, \nposition descriptions identifying the required qualifications and experience are not yet in place. \nHowever, these will be produced in the first month of the project, in fall 2022. The Health  \nCenters will consult with UVaCC OEO’s director about requirement for the navigator positions. \nWe plan is to complete recruitment for new hires within 90-days after the notice of funding \naward. In the last year CVHS has hired two Community Health Workers for the Petersburg area, \nand currently we are interviewing for two new Care Coordinator positions. The skills and \nexperience level for these positions is comparable to qualifications needed for the navigators and \nto some extent, the project director.  \n  \nCapability of key management staff to provide the operational and clinical oversight  \n    The management team at CVHS is composed of the CEO, CFO, Chief Clinical Officer (Dr. \nBashore, PI on this project), and Director of Clinical Operations, along with the Dental and BH \ndirectors, and Pharmacy director. Dr. Bashore has directed the medical department for over thirty \nyears. In his clinical oversight capacity, he has initiated several collaborative projects to increase \naccess to and quality of care, including the UVACC pilot. All CVHS leaders have decades of \nexperience leading the Health Center. The site managers and lead medical providers for all 8 \nproject sites will participate in this project, as will the Director of Nursing, EMR coordinator, \nQI/QA and Community Relations managers, and Outreach team.  \n     TACH will have several senior leadership team members involved with this project, over and \nabove the Clinical Managers at each clinic, Office Managers at each site, and Navigator. \nSpecifically, the Organizational Excellence Officer (OEO), who is a medical provider, also \nserves as the QI Coordinator and helps lead the QI Committee with the Medical Director. The \nmembers of the Clinical Leadership Team (Medical Director, Behavioral Health Director, \nPharmacy Director, and Clinical Operations Director) serve on the QI Committee so they will \nreceive regular updates on the project in that capacity. In addition, the OEO is leading an \nimprovement project around UDS clinical quality indicators, including colorectal and breast \ncancer screening, as described in the next section. She reports on the progress of these efforts to \nthe Clinical Leadership Team. The Clinical Operations Director, who is an RN, will be involved \nbecause of her oversight of the referral process and the Navigator will be under her supervision. \nFinally, the CEO was Chair of the QI Committee at the health center where he was employed"}, {"page": 27, "paragraph": 1, "text": "27  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nprior to TACH. In that role he collaborated with UVACC on a cancer-related project there, \nincluding co-authoring a publication on colorectal cancer screening, so he has a strong interest in \nthis project and will stay involved.  \n  \nEnsuring the provision of culturally affirming care  \n    Prior section of this narrative describe how the Health Centers work diligently to ensure that \npatients receive culturally affirming care. Indeed, cultural sensitivity for the individuals served at \nCVHS is stated clearly as an organizational value in its mission statements. CVHS has worked \nover the years to train its staff, including at orientation required for all new hires, about the \nimportance of considering patient’s individual needs and culture. Each year staff must complete \ncultural sensitivity training through its Relias platform. Interpretation services are available \nduring visits for non-English speaking patients. All staff at the Fredericksburg site that serves a \nhigh number of these individuals are bilingual. Several tools, including online resources and \ntelehealth technology, have been adopted to facilitate equitable access, and are used at all clinical \nsites, and available remotely.    \n     Like CVHS, TACH is committed to providing culturally responsive care and one of the \norganization’s core values is to provide a welcoming environment for patients and staff. TACH \nhas a Welcoming Working Group that is led by a physician. TACH has some bilingual staff and \nis attempting to hire more. The advertisement for the Navigator position will include a strong \npreference for a person who is bilingual in English and Spanish. All clinic sites have access to \nthe Stratus system for interpretation, material that has been translated to Spanish, and the website \nis available in Spanish. The Center has a Hispanic Advisory Team that meets every other week \nled by the CEO. Also, the CEO has been leading efforts to hold outreach events in counties with \nlarge Hispanic populations to provide screening, information, and referral information. Thus, the \ncancer screening and referral for care and treatment project described herein will be folded into \nthese larger organization efforts to provide equitable access to care.  \n  \nResources that Health Centers will leverage to support project implementation in addition \nto the partnership with UVACC  \n     Virginia has an active primary care association (VACHA) that also oversees the Health Center \nControlled Network. CVHS is a founding member, and both Centers are very active. VACHA \nbeen proactive in providing culturally-appropriate resources to all health centers in the state. If \nthis project is funded, CVHS will connect with VACHA for resources and ask for other referrals \nboth in-state and nationally. TACH has been involved with the Relay for Life in its service area \nand can reach out to local collaborators who are concerned about cancer.  \n     The UVA CCWW is a natural collaborator because they are a subunit of the UVACC and \nbecause TACH has been an active member for many years. In addition to the Relay for Life \nactivities noted above, TACH has partnered with the American Cancer Society and has \nconnections with their outreach personnel, including some with colorectal cancer expertise.  \n  \nPlan of Health Centers to sustain increased cancer screening and enhanced referral \ntracking efforts if funding is not available beyond the two-year project period  \n     As was noted earlier in this proposal, UVACC has committed to working with CVHS and \nTACH to establish a Collaborative with health centers around cancer screening and referral. In \naddition, the efforts that UVACC will contribute to establishing protocols at other health systems"}, {"page": 28, "paragraph": 1, "text": "28  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nwill extend beyond the length of this award period. CVHS and TACH are committed to \ncontinuing the progress made through this project by continuing to use improved processes and \nworkflows, having a Navigator on staff, and collaborating with other organizations.  \n  \nEVALUATIVE MEASURES   \n  \n1. \nBaseline UDS data for calendar year 2021 and estimated data showing increases in \nthe number and percentage of patients accessing cancer screening for each cancer type that \nyou are proposing to address by December 31, 2023  \n  \n• \nNumber and percentage of women screened for cervical cancer – N/A   \n• \nNumber and percentage of women who had a mammogram to screen for breast  \n• \ncancer  \n• \nNumber and percentage of adults screened for colorectal cancer: See Table 9 below  \n• \nNumber of women assisted with accessing appropriate follow up care within 30 days of \nreceiving an abnormal cervical cancer screening test result. – N/A   \n• \nNumber of women assisted with accessing appropriate follow-up care within 30 days of \nreceiving an abnormal breast cancer screening test result: See Table 9 below   \n• \nNumber of adults assisted with accessing appropriate follow-up care within 30 days of \nreceiving an abnormal colorectal cancer screening test result: See Table 9 below  \n2. \nProvide baseline data for calendar year 2021 and estimated data showing increases \nby December 31, 2023, for each cancer type that you are proposing to address:  \nTable 9.

We plan to reach these patients by doing mass \nmailing of FIT tests to all the eligible patients and then using our best practices to get the FITs \nreturned. For mammography, CVHS has reporting software to determine the patients out of \ncompliance for their mammograms and will share its data management practices with TACH. We \nplan to use the two new Patient Navigators to do outreach and scheduling of these patients for \nscreening mammograms with assistance for the logistics by UVACC and our partners. Then the \nHealth Centers will follow-up to ensure the mammograms were completed and that there was \nfollow-up on the results.  \n     In a pilot project CVHS undertook with UVACC from 2018 through 2021, 54 uninsured \nCVHS patients with a positive FIT result received individualized follow up and navigation \nsupport to obtain a colonoscopy from the UVA CRC screening coordinator. These activities \nachieved a high-level of follow up: among the 54 patients, 43 completed (80%) their \ncolonoscopy. The program involved mailing FIT kits to age-eligible uninsured patients and \nproviding patients with individual follow-up, communications and barrier removal as well as \naccessing a set fee colonoscopy at UVA. The success of this prior program demonstrates \neffective collaboration between UVACC and CVHS. It employed evidence-based initiatives to \nincrease screening rates and follow up. These will be applied and expanded within the proposed \nAxCSRC project.  \n     TACH derived its estimate based on the changes already being made organizationally (see \nbelow) and the anticipated additional improvements that will be made with the hiring of the \nPatient Navigator, learning from CVHS, and collaboration with UVACC as described in the \nsections above.  \n     Working closely with the UVA Comprehensive Cancer Center, over 6,550 patients of the two  \nCommunity Health Centers (CVHS and TACH) will be screened for colorectal cancer by \n12/31/23. By the same end date, an estimated 3,870 women will be screened for breast cancer by \nthe two Health Community Health Centers, in collaboration with their partners.    \n  \n3. Describe how Quality Improvement/Quality Assurance (QI/QA) program of the two \nHealth Centers will support the proposed AxCS project, including:  \n  \na) \nHow the Health Centers will include or will incorporate cancer screening and \nreferral for care and treatment activities and data into their QI/QA program  \n     CVHS has long had a Quality Improvement program, which is overseen by the Chief Clinical \nOfficer, working with the QI Coordinator. There is a QI Committee composed of medical, dental, \nand BH clinicians that meets monthly to review UDS clinical data and health outcomes for all \npatients. The clinical data shared informs decision-making about changes in services and new \nactivities CVHS will pursue. For 2022 CVHS has adopted a QI/QA goal to increase cancer \nscreening. Some of the clinical sites are focusing on CRC, others on breast cancer – so the data \nfor this project is already being incorporated into CVHS’ program and will be included in its \nStrategic Plan which will be revised during later 2022.  \n     TACH has implemented an overall organizational Fact-Based Management approach to \ndecision-making. The first area of focus was the Quality Pillar of the Strategic Plan. This focus \ncoincided with the submission of the 2021 UDS data. TACH noticed a trend in the data and"}, {"page": 30, "paragraph": 1, "text": "30  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \ndecided to institute a rapid cycle improvement project related to several clinical quality \nindicators, including colorectal and breast cancer screening. The 90-day cycle just ended and \ncolorectal cancer screening rates improved from 41% to 46% while breast cancer screening rates \nincreased from 38% to 45%. The QI Coordinator (who also is the TACH Organizational \nExcellence Officer), each site’s improvement team, and the overall TACH QI Committee will \ncontinue tracking these indicators, and the other UDS items, on a regular basis. Thus, it will not \nbe difficult to add tracking the referral for care and treatment metrics into the work they already \nare doing related to cancer screening.  \n  \nb) \nHow the QI/QA program of the two Health Centers will support evolution of the \nproject’s cancer screening and referral for care and treatment activities commensurate \nwith the evolving needs of Health Center patient populations and each service area      \nImproving access to screening and referrals for treatment is one of the reasons that CVHS \ndecided to invest in population health software (i2i) that is integrated with its EHR system. \nEnhanced data tools will support the growth of the Health Center, as it responds to the needs of \nclinic patients in its service area. The activities planned for this collaborative project, much like \nwhat CVHS found from its pilot with UVACC, are intrinsic to meeting objectives of its QI/QA \nprogram. All these efforts help to build a quality health care experience for the patient, \ncustomized to their individual need – and the new navigators will serve a critical role in making \nthat happen.  \n     As noted above, TACH is enhancing its utilization of data across the organization, including \nthe QI program. Three other pillars of its Strategic Plan are Community, Access, and Service \nExperience. All of these relate to the current proposal. Increasing community outreach, external \nand internal navigation, and referrals are associated with these pillars and therefore will be \nmeasured and tracked. This information can be sent to the QI Coordinator, who then can use the \ndata to determine whether QI efforts are necessary in one or more of these areas. The reciprocal \nnature of this data sharing will enhance each of the pillars, including Quality, while also \npositively impacting the quality of life of patients.  \n  \nc) \nHow the two Health Centers will use QI/QA reports for AxCS project improvement      \nCVHS’ QI report is completed quarterly and shared with the management team. Thereafter, it is \npresented to the Board of Directors who meet monthly. These reports are used to inform \ndecisions by the clinical team that are focused on improvement of services and will serve the \nsame purpose for enhancing and strengthening the AxCS project. Given TACH’s current focus \non cancer screening, and the planned addition of more closely tracking referrals for care and \ntreatment, there will be no difficulty in using QI reports for AxCS project improvement. The \nsame people will be involved in the QI efforts as in the AxCS project.  \n  \nd) \nHow the two Health Centers will include or incorporate into each organization’s \nQI/QA procedures and processes, current clinical guidelines, standards of care, and \nstandards of practice in the provision of cancer screening and referral for care and \ntreatment      Consistent with what is expressed above, both CVHS and TACH have been \nfocused on cancer screening for many months; this will continue. The additional emphasis on \nreferral for care and treatment and the partnership with UVACC will only enhance the work that \nis already being done internally by each health center. As ideas and suggestions are presented"}, {"page": 31, "paragraph": 1, "text": "31  \nPREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nthrough collaboration of the three organizations, these will be discussed by both Center’s QI \nCommittees, the Medical/Clinical Directors and QI Directors, and each of the participating site’s \nimprovement teams. Thus, CVHS and TACH will be able to be at the cutting edge of cancer \nscreening and referral for care and treatment because of their collaboration in advancing this \nproject.  \n  \n  \nSUPPORT REQUESTED  \n  \n    The budget for this AxCS project has been completed consistent with other parts of this \napplication, including the budget narrative and staff justification. It was developed based on \nCVHS' previous experience. The budget for each year of the project includes 3 staff members to \nbe hired (2 patient navigators and 1 part-time project director), the cost of purchasing and mail \ndistribution of FIT tests ($36,000) to be used by each Health Center, the contract with UVACCC \nas NIC-designated partner ($20,000), financial assistance for patients needing transportation \n($7,000), subscription for the i2i population health tool ($4,740), and laptops, cell phones, and \nsupplies for the patient navigators. Depending on how this project evolves, CVHS will use \nnonfederal grant funding to add positions with the knowledge and understanding that once those \ngrants expire, the organization can sustain these screening, referral, and outreach activities to \ncontinue meeting the needs of people in its service area.

(CVHS) is the applicant for this HRSA Accelerating Cancer Screenings \nFunding Opportunity. CVHS is Virginia’s oldest and largest federally qualified community health center (FQHC).  \nCurrently the organization offers integrated primary medical, pharmacy and laboratory services, dental, and \nbehavioral health (BH), including an addiction use disorder treatment program. Mammography and x-ray are available \nat the original health center located in rural Buckingham County. CVHS operates 20 sites covering a large service \narea that includes nineteen localities (15 counties and 4 cities). Over half of CVHS sites are in rural, medically \nunderserved communities; the rest serve urban areas with low poverty populations. In 2021 CVHS served over 48,000 \npatients.  \n     The focus of this Rural Communities Collaborative cancer screening project is breast and colorectal cancer  \n(CRC). CVHS and its neighboring community health center, Tri Area Community Health (TACH), will work closely with \nthe University of Virginia Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Office of Community Outreach and Engagement to execute \nthe project workplan. The goal is to increase screenings for breast and colorectal cancer and follow up across the \ncombined 27 counties and 2 cities served by CVHS and TACH. The University of Virginia Cancer Center is one of two \nNCI-designated cancer centers in the state.  \n     Tri Area Community Health operates 5 sites in the Blue Ridge Mountain region of Southwest Virginia. It has \nserved the area for over 40 years. Comprehensive primary medical and BH services are provided at all sites except \none, where BH is provided to complement medical care offered by the existing rural health clinic and free clinic. \nTACH’s service area is in the economically depressed Appalachian region, with the median household income almost \n$30,000 lower than the Virginia median. TACH served over 10,000 patients in 2021.  \n     Each of the communities served by the two Health Centers has unique characteristics, with clinics developed, \nover time, to meet the needs of people living in that region. Accessible primary care for all populations, \nespecially for the medically underserved, is the goal. In rural communities, lack of primary care providers, \ndistance, low health literacy, and poverty are major barriers to care, in addition to other social factors that \nmay negatively impact health outcomes. Urban residents more frequently face poverty, linguistic challenges, poor \neducational achievement, or cultural barriers. Common themes include lack of insurance, health disparities, and \nthe need for affordable care for prevention of diseases, including cancer.   \n     The proposed project will address the needs of the targeted population at each of the thirteen project sites \nover a two-year period. Activities include the provision of information about the importance of cancer screening \nfor breast and colorectal cancer; distribution and follow up of FIT tests; mammography services; expansion of \nreferral relationships with UVACC, hospital systems serving southwest Virginia, and specialty practices; \nnavigation customized for individual patients; outreach health education; financial assistance; and development of \ncollaboration with community partners.  \n   The budget includes hiring one Patient Navigator for each FQHC, and funding for a contract with UVACC. The  \nCancer Center will provide a Program Manager to work closely with the two Health Centers, and services of outreach \nspecialists. Over 6,550 patients will be screened for colorectal cancer by 12/31/23, and an estimated 6,000 women"}, {"page": 35, "paragraph": 1, "text": "PREVIEW Date: Jun 15, 2022 \nWorkspace ID: WS00922949 Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-22-154 \nwill be screened for breast cancer.

Outline the terms in this overview – including total grant\nrequest, grant period and timing. How will the project build over time? If it is building on a previous\nprogram please include how it has evolved and led to this place.\nWe kindly ask Anonymous Granter to provide $200,000 over two years to cover general operations at\nGateway Pet Guardians (GPG). This much needed and appreciated grant would allow GPG to\nstrengthen and stabilize programming after two years of great growth.\nIn January 2020, we moved into a 54,000 square foot building in East St. Louis to better meet the\nmission to empower pet owners in Illinois’ East Side Pet District - East St. Louis, Cahokia Heights,\nWashington Park and Fairmont City. Because of the pandemic, the ofﬁcial opening was delayed until\nAugust 2020, which means 2021 was our ﬁrst full year of operation in the new location. Before the\nmove, we operated from a 2,000 square foot building in St. Louis City, traveling to the East Side Pet\nDistrict for intake and outreach.\nWith the move, we added a low-cost, full-service veterinary clinic and affordable pet supply retail\nstore, as well as an on-site pet pantry and professional grooming spa to our current program offerings.\nThe new programs required a 30 percent increase in staff. We have become a true partner to the\ncommunity, providing multiple resources to help families keep their beloved pets. As awareness of our\norganization quickly spread, the numbers for all of our programs increased substantially.\nAnonymous Granter’s grant will play a key role as we work to reﬁne and stabilize the growth from the\nlast two years. While 2020 and 2021 were focused on creation and growth, in 2022 and 2023, we want\nto improve upon the programs that already exist. To ensure we are able to continue serving the\ncommunity, it is important to focus on long-term stability. With that in mind, we will be embarking on\na strategic plan this August.\n2.\nNeed: Brieﬂy summarize the need for the project/program.\nGPG serves a community of rescue minded animal lovers in a region considered a resource desert,\nincluding a lack of access to affordable, quality pet services. Racism and inequitable access to\nresources is an issue many in our community face every day, where 85 percent of the service area is\nblack. We are a partner in the community, working with pet-loving community members to provide\nthe tools and services they need to remove barriers to ownership.\nA brief breakdown of the service area economic demographic:\n●\n40 percent of the population lives under the poverty line\n●\nthe median household income is just under $28,000\n●\n52 percent of the population rents\nThe reality for the animal welfare industry is that the old system of intake and adoption is not the\nsolution to animal homelessness. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to\nAnimals (ASPCA), approximately 6.3 million animals enter the shelter system each year. Around 4.1\nmillion of those animals are adopted out and 810,000 are returned to their owners. Aside from the\nsigniﬁcant gap of animals left in the system, it’s imperative to address the alarming number of animals\nthat ﬁrst arrive into the shelter system.\nThe need that we serve is to remove the barriers of ownership to ensure that pets do not enter the\nshelter system in the ﬁrst place. We do this through affordable and accessible veterinary care,\njudgment-free outreach, pet pantries and other lifesaving services. By making pet ownership\naffordable and providing accessible resources to the community, we ensure that anyone who loves\ntheir pet has the ability to keep it.\nGPG is the only program in the region and one of the few in the nation who not only offers a full\nservice low-cost veterinary clinic, but also a full range of resources to the pet community we serve.\nWe strive to stand as a model for other organizations trying to make a difference in their own\ncommunity. Staff speak and participate in numerous local and national conversations, including"}, {"page": 3, "paragraph": 1, "text": "webinars, conferences and features from reputable industry and news organizations like Americans\nPets Alive!, ASPCA, Best Friends Animal Society, The Washington Post and The Associated Press.\n3.\nCollaborations: Please also note the other organizations with which you are collaborating and in what\ncapacity you will collaborate.\nCollaboration is a key part of our many programs. We have an extensive network of collaborators for\nour community cat trap-neuter-return (TNR) initiative, which consists of multiple local animal shelters\nand rescues coming together for several large scale spay/neuter events throughout the year. We also\nwork very closely with the local animal control to intake cats and dogs from their facility, as well as\nassist with temperament testing and returning lost pets to their owners.\nAdditionally, we partner with the Bi-State Pet Food Pantry, a local organization who provides\nemergency pet food assistance, and we also serve as the regional afﬁliate for Rescue Bank, a program\nof Greater Good Charities, which provides low-cost pet food and supplies to local animal shelters and\nrescues. On top of that, we are also a member of IMPETUS - A Coalition for Pet Progress (formerly the\nSt. Louis Petlover Coalition), which is made up of animal rescue groups, shelters and veterinary\norganizations, as well as city and county health ofﬁcials to improve animal welfare through shared\ngoals and plans.\nAside from pet focused partnerships, we work closely with the Clyde C. Jordan Senior Center in East\nSt. Louis to provide food for senior citizens in our community and the St. Louis Area Foodbank to\nprovide pet food for their monthly “Food on the Move” event.\n4.\nOrganization Background: Include a basic (2-3 paragraphs) description and history of the organization.\nGPG was founded in 2004 at a time when the homeless animal population was increasing rapidly in\nthe East Side Pet District. With little attention being paid to families residing in a resource desert,\nincluding a lack of access to affordable, quality pet services, we made it our mission to change the\nlandscape. Over the years, our community partnerships have grown stronger as more residents know\nwe are here to help address the homeless animal population.\nIn 2012, we launched our spay/neuter program and formalized community outreach efforts the\nfollowing year. As a result, the community saw a radical decline in the number of stray animals. Since\nthen, animal intake at our local animal control has massively decreased. In 2020, we moved\noperations to a former elementary school in the heart of East St. Louis, allowing us to better serve our\ncommunity through accessible resources such as a low-cost veterinary clinic, pet supply retail store\nand professional grooming services.\n5.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion: What progress has your organization made to increase its diversity,\nequity, and inclusion in the past two to three years? What are its plans for the next two to three years?\nIn 2019, GPG changed its adoption and foster application process to be much more inclusive,\nwelcoming and impartial. Historically, we required home inspections of adopters and fosters, as well\nas questions regarding employment and other invasive topics not indicative of someone’s ability to\ntake care of a pet in need. This approach was and is still standard practice for many animal shelters\nand rescues today.\nDuring her time as Program Director, Alisha Vianello, who is now GPG’s Executive Director was hired\nto manage the adoption and foster programs. While overseeing these programs, Alisha removed the\nrequirement for home visits and reference checks, as well as implemented a condensed, neutral\nadoption and foster request form that focuses on basic information for pet matchmaking purposes\nversus screening applicants. Along with these improvements, Alisha focused on educating current\nvolunteers and staff on eliminating bias in the adoption and foster process. Aside from a few naysayers"}, {"page": 4, "paragraph": 1, "text": "who opposed the change and made the decision to leave, this new approach has been embraced with\nopen arms by our compassionate and caring supporters.\nIn the last three years, we have increased service area adoptions by 500 percent and aim to grow\ndiversity across the board. Our goal is to continue to increase the number of adoptions in our service.\nLast February, we formed a racial equity committee with a two-fold purpose: Illuminate and dismantle\nracial disparities in organization policy, operations and program outcomes, as well as create a culture\nwithout prejudice and encourage trauma-informed care to anyone representing GPG. To accomplish\nthese goals, the committee formalized a racial equity plan and drafted an organizational mandate. Key\ncomponents of the plan include:\n●\nAdopting a common language around racial equity;\n●\nExamining external and internal outcomes for racial disparities through the disaggregation of\ndata by race/ethnicity;\n●\nTraining staff and volunteers on trauma-informed principles, ethical storytelling and\nanti-racism principles;\n●\nAuditing organizational policies and activities to align with best practices for promoting racial\nequity; and\n●\nCreating regular opportunities for reporting on our progress, oversights and plans by\nprioritizing budget and stafﬁng to support equity work.\nOne of the ﬁrst committee initiatives was to prioritize hiring from our service area. We maintain a\nformal list of community members who are interested in employment opportunities and when\npositions become available, we solicit that list ﬁrst. Since implementing this strategy, three new hires\nhave been from our service area. Additionally, we are in the process of applying for a grant to attend\nthe Companions and Animals for Reform and Equity (CARE) Racial Equity, Diversity and Inclusion\n(REDI) training program hosted by Maddie’s University - Maddie’s Fund, which is speciﬁcally created\nfor animal shelters and rescues.\nDescribe the reach of this project (or organization if this is an application for general operating support).\nHow does it work to reﬂect the community it works within?\nGPG is a pioneer of community-based pet resource centers. To provide much-needed services to\nkeep pets with their families, we focus on select service areas in Illinois - East St. Louis, Cahokia\nHeights, Washington Park and Fairmont City. We provide a breadth of services to the East Side Pet\nDistrict, focusing on strays, owner surrenders and most importantly, keeping pets in their homes.\nAs a model for American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA)’s “One Health” approach, national\nanimal welfare organizations such as Best Friends Animal Society and Human Animal Support Services\n(HASS) are looking to us as leaders to further the connection among animal, human and environmental\nhealth through two central ideas: Humans, animals and the world we live in are inextricably linked;\nand two, the collaborative effort of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally and globally to\nattain optimal health for people, animals and the environment. As the human population continues to\ngrow and our relationships with animals continue to evolve, understanding the interdependencies of\npeople, animals and the environment becomes even more critical to our collective health and safety.\nWe serve communities that are located in a resource desert, including a lack of access to affordable,\nquality pet services such as veterinary care and pet supplies. The closest veterinary clinic is 10 miles\naway in a community ﬁlled with pet lovers dedicated to the betterment of the East Side Pet District. As\na partner in the community, we share in this sentiment and are driven to help our pet owners thrive\nthrough lifesaving resources.\nAffordable and accessible veterinary care\nEquitable access to veterinary care is something every community needs to ensure happy, healthy\npets.\nVeterinary\ncare\nshould be accessible to everyone, regardless of zip code, income,"}, {"page": 5, "paragraph": 1, "text": "employment-status or housing-type. Our full-service veterinary clinic ensures everyone in the East\nSide Pet District has the opportunity to receive low-cost vaccines, medical care and lifesaving\npreventatives. Additionally, our clinic handles more life-threatening conditions, including severe bodily\ninjuries, cancers and heartworms. Unfortunately, many of our clients delay treatment due to fear of\ncost and judgment, causing their pet’s condition to worsen.\nWith affordability being a critical component of improving access to vet care, we price our services to\nbe at cost for this reason. For example, an amputation at our clinic costs between $150-$200 per\nhour. This is a surgery that can easily cost $1,000-$2,000 somewhere else. We do not require clients\nto prove ﬁnancial need. If a client is unable to pay, we offer a payment plan with no penalties and no\ncredit check so no one has to fear losing their pet or having a pet remain sick because of ﬁnancial\nhardships.\nWhile still being relatively new to the community, we actively work with community members on\nboth awareness and trust through continuous outreach and marketing. As availability is also a\nhindrance, the schedule is a ﬁrst come, ﬁrst serve walk-in format - vaccines twice a week and medical\ntreatment clinics on Fridays. We also host monthly drive-thru clinics the ﬁrst Saturday of the month\nbetween March and November, offering services vaccinations, microchips and topical ﬂea\npreventative treatment. With stafﬁng, there are currently two veterinarians, as well as a clinic\nmanager, licensed technician and clinic assistant. The low-cost prices cover many of the supply costs\nfor the clinic, while the salaries and large equipment needs are covered through grants and donations.\nKeeping pets with their people: Community outreach and support\nAs part of our community-focused programming, there are many ways we work to keep pets with the\npeople who love them through a well-rounded approach.\nCommunity support program\nThe community support program includes a full-time, licensed social worker who helps those in our\nservice area keep their pets long-term. The social worker connects clients to services that best ﬁt their\nsituation and mediate problems by serving as a referral source. Additionally, this role helps clients\nnavigate the process of ﬁnding appropriate resources and addressing barriers so that clients can move\nforward. These referrals include East St. Louis or St. Clair Housing Authority, Community Lifeline and\nPuentes de Esperanza.\nProviding food and supplies\nWe provide multiple outlets for those living in our service area to get the resources they need to keep\ntheir pets. Through these programs, we distributed 29 tons of food and litter last year. Additionally, the\nWellness at Gateway (WAG) program provided free food and litter to 165 qualifying families in 2021\nWe also have a partnership with the St. Louis Area Foodbank to give out food when their mobile\npantry is in our area. To further remove barriers, we also sell bulk pet food in our retail store at $0.25\nper pound, which is open to everyone.\nFree community spay/neuter program\nA spay/neuter procedure can be prohibitively expensive, which leads to many accidental puppies and\nkittens. To increase the number of spayed/neutered animals in our community, as well as reduce\nowner surrenders and the homeless pet population, we provide free spay/neuter to anyone who lives\nwithin our service area. This program is extremely popular and on average, appointments have a six\nweek lead time. Additionally, we also have a robust TNR program and work closely with community\nferal cat feeders to spay/neuter and provide supplies for the cats in their care. In 2021, 322 community\ncats came through our TNR program, which was a 70 percent increase from the previous year..\nJudgment free approach to outreach and education\nOur staff and volunteers commit to reaching out to the community. We receive requests from\ncommunity members to check in on various pets. On a weekly basis, we will go out to distribute\nsupplies, provide information on services and offer a judgment-free approach to any problems. During\nsevere weather, staff and volunteers will provide items such as hay and crates/houses to help keep\noutdoor animals safe and comfortable. Through this approach, we are able to provide veterinary care,\nspay/neuter procedures and provide solutions to keep animals off the streets."}, {"page": 6, "paragraph": 1, "text": "Intake, foster and adoption\nThere will always be dogs and cats that need homes. In 2021, we took in 1,139 pets from our service\narea - 456 cats/kittens and 410 dogs/puppies. This was a 30 percent increase from 2020 and 100\npercent increase from 2019. On average, it costs $250 to provide basic intake vetting for a healthy dog.\nA third of the adult dogs we see are heartworm positive, which quickly over doubles the vetting costs.\nCats and dogs arrive through several avenues such as local animal control or owner surrender. If it\ncomes through local animal control or as a stray, we will make every attempt to ﬁnd the owner. Every\nanimal goes through intake vetting, which includes vaccinations and wellness exams. For kittens and\npuppies, we place them directly into foster care. With adults, they go through intake until they are\nplaced in foster or on the adoption ﬂoor. With a network of more than 450 fosters, we try to place the\nmajority in temporary loving homes. Foster homes are the ideal location for a pet to decompress and\ndiscover more about its personality in a home setting. Despite having 54,000 square feet of space, we\nonly have space for 22 dogs and 25 cats on site (not including community cats from the TNR program).\nWe have a low-barrier adoption process as we believe everyone deserves the love of a pet regardless\nof zip code, income, employment-status or housing-type. To ensure this, we eliminate barriers such as\nhome checks or invasive applications. We also have volunteers work as matchmakers to help\nadopters ﬁnd the right ﬁt.

animal welfare\nand Human Resource Management (HRM). In 2019, she made the leap\nfrom the corporate world to her dream job helping our pet welfare\ncommunity thrive. As Program Director, she oversaw all facets of\nanimal care – shelter, veterinary and foster support, as well as\nintake/rescue, adoption and volunteer programming.

Jill\nhas been working and volunteering in animal welfare since 2006.\nLessons Learned\n●\nIf this project is part of an evolved effort, please describe any lessons learned from previous work.\nHow did you shift to address the challenge?\nClinic: Since opening in 2020, one of the lessons learned is that a traditional veterinary clinic set up is\nnot necessarily conducive to our community needs. During its ﬁrst year, the clinic operated primarily\nby appointment, booking a month in advance with a majority not showing up. This approach failed as\nmany of our clients live paycheck-to-paycheck so they hold off planning and seeking care. This past\nNovember, we switched to a ﬁrst come, ﬁrst serve walk-in model, which has been well-received and\nincreased efﬁciency and volume of pets receiving care. With the pandemic, many things came to a\nhalt, including providing vaccinations. To provide vaccinations safely, we changed our monthly format\nto a drive up system. Our drive-thru clinics have been so successful that we adopted the system\npermanently for our monthly vaccination clinics.\nStaff Retention: Animal welfare positions tend to have very low wages with high rates of turnover due\nto burnout from limited support and the emotional nature of this industry. GPG previously fell into this\ncategory and was chronically understaffed. To increase equity in the community and retain staff, GPG\nadded health, dental and vision insurance for the ﬁrst time in 2020. Additionally, last year we raised the\nminimum wage for staff to $15 an hour and added a 401K plan with an employer match. We also\nbrought on additional stafﬁng and implemented a self-care plan to promote work/life balance and\nsupport mental health.\nThe organization has been growing at rapid rates for the past two years with the transition to our new\nfacility and is now at the point of stabilizing and maintaining programming for long-term success."}, {"page": 10, "paragraph": 1, "text": "8.\nProject Budget\nPlease complete the attached.\n9.\nFinancial Information/Sustainability\nPlease brieﬂy describe the plan to make the project or organization sustainable after the grant period (if\napplicable).\nGPG works hard to have a diverse source of funding for the organization to help ensure future stability.\nThis includes two signature events, several peer-to-peer fundraisers, direct mail and major gift\nfundraising. Since 2020, our fundraising efforts have increased signiﬁcantly due to the new facility. By\nhiring a seasoned development director and having the executive director commit half of their time to\nfundraising, we have demonstrated our commitment to sustainable growth. With the addition of new\ndevelopment stafﬁng, we upgraded our donor management database and started building out a major\ngifts program.

The program aims to create equitable access to \nhealthcare by providing lodging for caregivers and medically stable patients seeking treatment at \nCharlotte hospitals. For a nominal nightly fee of $50, guests receive a private room and restroom and \naccess to a fully stocked kitchen and pantry, laundry facilities and supplies, parking, and transportation \nto and from hospital systems. \nRecent inflation has increased HHOC’s program operating expenses by 20%, and guest fees account for \nonly a portion of these costs. Support from \n will keep fees at a minimum for guests who are \nfacing the high expenses of medical treatment. At a program operating cost of $90 per room, per night, \na gift of $25,000 provides 278 families with accommodations and related support services. \nCommon Goals (1000 character maximum) \nDescribe how a grant to your organization would further the foundation's mission and the priorities of \nthe foundation. \nA grant awarded to HHOC would further \n’s mission by providing a fundamental human service \nto individuals in need of safe, overnight lodging while receiving life-sustaining medical treatment. When \nfaced with the high costs of medical bills, families should not have to choose between shelter and \nhealthcare. \n“My daughter was admitted unexpectedly. We really appreciate Hospitality House. We were having to \nsleep in our car because we couldn't stay with her and didn't have money for a motel room.” (HHOC \nGuest, 2022) \nThe vast majority of HHOC guests reside in rural areas of the US where their recommended treatment is \nnonexistent. HHOC provides a necessary human service that facilitates access to critical medical care to \ncreate more positive health outcomes for patients and their caregivers. \nDemographics comments (optional) (1000 character maximum) \nHHOC serves patients of any age and diagnosis referred to Charlotte-area hospitals from any location. \nLast year, 84% of guests came from North or South Carolina, 39% came from more than 100 miles away, \nand 27% lived less than 60 miles from Charlotte. \nAlthough HHOC does not target any particular demographic, 52% of guests surveyed this fiscal year \nhave household incomes less than $45,000, including 16% from incomes less than $20,000."}, {"page": 2, "paragraph": 1, "text": "Most guests are facing cancer, transplantation, cardiac issues, or trauma, but a wide variety of diagnoses \nare served. 21% of all guests served last year were patients who, without Hospitality House, would have \nto remain in the hospital longer than necessary, pay costly hotel rates, or face the exhaustion of \nfrequent trips back and forth from home. \n“A serious illness is so expensive that anything that can reduce the financial impact is desperately \nneeded. Hospitality House made us feel less alone at the most difficult time of my life.” (HHOC Guest, \n2022) \nREQUEST DETAIL \nDescribe the objectives of the project or program to be funded. (4000 character max) \nHHOC aims to achieve its vision of access to health for all by reducing costs for families in medical crisis, \nimproving health outcomes through shorter hospital stays, and providing proximity to world-class \nhealthcare that is more necessity than convenience. \nThe high costs of ongoing medical treatment negatively impact patient health. For example, families \nfacing cancer make up the majority of HHOC’s guests each year, and 45% of cancer patients with \nmedical debt delayed or avoided medical care for serious issues (American Cancer Society, 2022). \nConsidering the nightly rates of local hotels, HHOC offset nearly $2 million in lodging costs for patients \nand caregivers last year, alleviating some of the financial burdens associated with ongoing medical care. \nBased on trends in the average length of stay for its guests, HHOC anticipates offsetting an average of \napproximately $1000 in lodging costs per family. \nShorter hospital stays reduce medical fees, lower mortality rates and risks of infection, and improve \ntreatment outcomes (National Library of Medicine, 2019). HHOC aims to be a resource to patients who \nneed to remain close to their care but are medically stable enough to stay outside of the hospital. \nAdditionally, this program’s services will help to increase hospital efficiency by ensuring available beds \nare utilized for patients whose treatment does not allow them to be discharged. \nLocation causes financial and geographical disparities in health. For example, 96% of guests came from \nthe southern region of the US, which reports the highest share of medical debt (US Census, 2020). \nAdditionally, 91% of guests served last year resided in rural areas of the United States where only 3% of \nmedical oncologists practice (National Cancer Institute, 2022), forcing patients in these areas to travel to \nunfamiliar cities for life-sustaining medical care. HHOC expects the majority of beneficiaries of the \nOvernight Lodging Program will reside in these rural areas and aims to increase access to vital medical \ncare for these patients. \nDescribe the implementation plan for the project or program. Include at least three specific actions \nyour organization will take in order to achieve results. (4000 character max) \nThe Overnight Lodging Program offers 20 private bedrooms for patients and their caregivers less than \ntwo miles from the major campuses of Atrium Health and Novant Health. These local hospitals are the \nfirst step in bringing guests to Hospitality House, as patients are directed to the organization through a \nformal referral process. HHOC’s operations team will continue to work closely with representatives of \nthese hospital systems to educate referring agents and ensure its services are a known resource to \npatients. \nBy strengthening community partnerships, growing volunteerism, and increasing donor support, HHOC \nwill work to keep fees at a minimum for its guests.  \nCollaboration with local businesses brings in-kind goods and services that help HHOC keep operational \ncosts minimalized. For example, HHOC established a relationship with ABM Industries this past year. The"}, {"page": 3, "paragraph": 1, "text": "company provided painting services valued at $7,700 to HHOC at no cost. Utilizing these partnerships \noffsets a portion of operational expenses associated with facility upkeep so that additional costs do not \nimpact guest fees. HHOC staff will continue to foster existing relationships with local businesses and \ncreate new ones that benefit the organization. \nAdditionally, HHOC will work with local organizations to create customized, engaging volunteer \nprograms serving guest needs. Volunteers provide nutritious meals, donated supplies, and other \nservices that reduce operational expenses and allow guests to focus on self-care and recovery rather \nthan everyday stressors. \nStaff will continue practices outlined in HHOC's comprehensive, three-year development plan. \nFundraising efforts include diversified revenue streams and intentional focus on donor cultivation and \nstewardship. Through creative outreach strategies and continued education of best practices, HHOC will \nfortify existing relationships with donors and establish ones that increase revenue for the program.  \nWhat criteria does (or will) your organization use to measure the success of the project or program? \n(4000 character max) \nAll 2,080 guests HHOC anticipates serving this fiscal year will benefit directly from safe, overnight \nlodging in close proximity to their necessary healthcare. Through a post-stay survey, guests directly \nevaluate the facility, illustrate program impact, and affirm the essential need for HHOC’s services. \n“If it wasn't for Hospitality House, I wouldn't have been able to get my two weeks of radiation \ntreatments. The pain was so bad from the cancer in my bones that I couldn't care for my family and \nthings at home as a mother. I live in the woods in the mountains of NC, and we live on one minimum \nwage income for our four-person family.” (HHOC Guest, 2022) \nHHOC compares guest survey results to national statistics through its membership in the Healthcare \nHospitality Network (HHN), an organization consisting of medical hospitality houses throughout the \ncountry. HHOC considers its services successful if internal survey responses regarding patient health and \nstress level align with results achieved at peer organizations. \nHHOC also looks to direct feedback from valued community partners to ensure its services are \nbeneficial. Families are referred to HHOC’s offered accommodations through partnerships with \nCharlotte’s major hospital systems. HHOC aims to be a critical part of each medical journey and improve \npatient outcomes. \n“Hospitality House is such a natural extension of Atrium Health’s mission to improve health, elevate \nhope, and advance healing for all. The synergy and partnership of Atrium Health and Hospitality House is \nmaking a positive difference in the lives of those we serve.” (Vicki Block, SVP; Market President, \nCharlotte Market, Atrium Health) \nCollaboration (4000 character max) \nBriefly describe any formal or informal collaborative ventures your organization has established (or will \nestablish) with other entities serving similar purposes that may be relevant to this grant request \nHospitality House values its many, mutually beneficial relationships with local nonprofits. In 2021, HHOC \nestablished a partnership with Community Culinary School of Charlotte (CCSC), which provides \nworkforce development training and job placement assistance for adults who face barriers to long-term \nsuccessful employment. Since then, CCSC students have been preparing healthy meals for various \nholidays throughout the year for HHOC guests. This partnership brings meaningful impact to families \nfacing medical crises and contributes to CCSC students’ culinary training."}, {"page": 4, "paragraph": 1, "text": "“I [spent] Christmas and New Year’s away from home. I was deeply touched by the meal that awaited \nme - pork roast, rice, grilled vegetables! Thank you for your effort, labor, and preparation to care so well \nfor a stranger.” (Pam, HHOC Guest) \nHope Haven has been providing weekly laundry services to Hospitality House since 2013. The \norganization provides a foundation of recovery for those impacted by substance use disorder so they \ncan build healthy, independent lives. The services they provide contribute to workforce development \ntraining within their programs and reduce operating costs for Hospitality House. Additionally, Hope \nHaven recently invited HHOC staff to attend a self-care day at their facility. \nHospitality House is a resource to Madelyn’s Fund, which provides housing support to families of infant \nand pediatric patients of Charlotte-area hospitals. \n“Many of the families we work with find themselves far from home, taking unexpected time away from \nwork and incur additional expenses related to transportation and lodging. Because of Hospitality House, \nthese families were able to be at their baby’s bedside every day and were present for many ‘firsts’ they \nmight have otherwise missed, such as their child’s first smile or first feeding.” (Sarah Turza, Madelyn’s \nFund Program Manager) \nRonald McDonald House of Charlotte is the only other healthcare hospitality house in the Charlotte \narea. Though they specifically serve families of patients who are under 21 years of age, their mission is \nsimilar to HHOC and therefore collaboration provides an opportunity for sharing industry best practices \nand helpful insights. HHOC maintains regularly scheduled meetings with Ronald McDonald House \nleadership. \nProject background (4000 character maximum) \nIf this grant request relates to an ongoing project or program, how long has the project or program been \noperating? \nFor the last 37 years, HHOC has advanced equitable access to healthcare through private, low-cost \naccommodations in close proximity to Charlotte’s hospital systems. HHOC opened in 1985 as a safe, \ndignified alternative to sleeping in hospital waiting rooms or personal vehicles after a survey of local \nmedical personnel cited an overwhelming need for housing families of patients. When the need for \nHHOC’s services quickly outgrew its 14 available beds, the current facility was built considering not only \nfamily members but also medically stable patients who need to remain close to their care. Today, HHOC \ncan hold up to 80 patients and caregivers per night as they navigate difficult medical journeys. \nOther project funding \nList other sources that may fund this project.

It was \nestablished in 1942 by the Junior League of Greater Fort Lauderdale, originally to provide childcare for \nwomen entering the workforce as their husbands fought in World War II. Today, 80 years later, Jack & Jill \nCenter is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) community-based organization that provides comprehensive, holistic, \nwraparound support services to children of high-need parents who work or attend school in order to \nimprove their well-being and quality of life. To date, Jack & Jill Center has served nearly 20,000 children \nand families.  \nOur Early Education Program provides quality, year-round early childhood education focusing on enabling \nchildren to grow emotionally, physically, and socially in a safe, caring environment using age-appropriate \nmethods for cognitive growth. Jack & Jill Center is one of only two NAEYC (National Association for the \nEducation of Young Children) accredited centers in Fort Lauderdale. Research has long documented the \npositive outcomes of high-quality early childhood education, including readiness for school, greater \nacademic achievement, high rates of high school and college completion, lower rates of incarceration, \nand higher incomes.  \nJack & Jill Center respectfully requests a grant in the amount of $__ from the [Name of Foundation] to \nsupport our mission to strengthen children and families through innovative education, supportive \nprogramming, and community engagement. We invite you to partner with us as we continue in our \nmission to serve disadvantaged children and families in Broward County.  \nTHE VALUE OF INVESTING IN EARLY LEARNING  \nExtensive research confirms that preschool plays a pivotal role in the academic success of underserved \nchildren. In low-income communities, the scarcity of quality early childhood education poses a significant \nchallenge, as many children enter kindergarten ill-equipped to compete with their more privileged peers. \nThey face a deficit in language and social skills right from the start, creating an uphill battle – a cycle that \noften remains unbroken due to the lack of guidance for their parents. However, by providing high-quality \nearly childhood education, we can empower all children to start on equal footing and achieve lasting \nsuccess. Numerous studies consistently demonstrate the numerous benefits of early school enrollment, \nsuch as lifelong academic accomplishments, increased graduation rates, reduced delinquency rates, and \na decreased need for special education services. Renowned economist James Heckman emphasizes that \ncommunity investing in quality preschool programs yields a remarkable 7-10% return per year over a \nchild's lifetime.  \nThe Perry Preschool Study stands as a \ncomprehensive testament to the long-term \nimpacts of early education, as it evaluated \nindividuals at the age of 40. Remarkably, the \nstudy's findings reveal that those who had the \nopportunity to attend preschool programs \nexperienced \nhigher \nearnings, \nexhibited \ngreater employment rates, demonstrated a \nreduced likelihood of engaging in criminal \nactivities, and were more likely to have \nsuccessfully graduated from high school \ncompared to their peers who lacked access to \npreschool education."}, {"page": 3, "paragraph": 1, "text": "3 \n \nFurthermore, a noteworthy 2004 study conducted by the Economic Policy Institute highlights the \nsubstantial returns that taxpayers can expect from investing in quality child care and education. For \nevery dollar invested, taxpayers can recoup more than $2.50, while simultaneously benefiting the \nfamilies involved.  \nSTATEMENT OF NEED \nThe data from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey reveals a sobering reality: in \nBroward County, a staggering 255,000 individuals currently live below the federal poverty line. Out of the \ntotal of 694,980 households in Broward County, an alarming 50% find themselves residing at or below the \nAsset Limited, Income Constrained Employed (ALICE) threshold, as outlined in the United Way's 2020 \nALICE Report update. \n \nWithin this context, it is crucial to recognize the unique circumstances faced by the families at Jack & Jill \nCenter. The center primarily serves single working mothers, who, despite their determination and effort, \nfind themselves within 175% of the poverty level, with a median income of $28,500. These resilient \nfamilies raise more than one child, a challenging feat when juxtaposed with the stark contrast of the \nannual Household Survival Budget of $69,516, an amount necessary for an average Florida family of four \nto make ends meet (ALICE Report 2020). \n \nIt is worth highlighting that a significant number of our families hail from three specific zip codes: 33311, \n33312, and 33313. Regrettably, these areas have long grappled with elevated poverty rates, instances of \nabuse and neglect, accidental deaths, and a persistent cycle of intergenerational poverty. \n \nThe burdensome struggle of securing reliable and affordable child care creates an inescapable cycle of \npoverty that persists across generations. The absence of stable child care often compels parents to \ndiscontinue their education or job training, leading to frequent absences from work and high turnover \nrates. Consequently, parents face significant obstacles in attaining steady incomes, career progression, \nand overall stability for themselves and their children. Moreover, poverty can hinder a child's capacity to \nlearn and contribute to a range of social, emotional, and behavioral issues, as well as adverse health and \nmental health outcomes. \n \nExtensive research has consistently highlighted the transformative impact of high-quality early childhood \neducation on children's development.

Achieving this re-accreditation is direct result of staff from across the organization \nworking together to provide the highest quality educational opportunities for our children. \nCurricula \nTeachers engage children in activities including art, math, literacy, science, \nmusic, puzzles, manipulatives, and physical education using the nationally-\nrecognized Creative Curriculum©. This award-winning, research-based \ncurriculum is widely regarded as a forward-thinking, comprehensive, and \nculturally rich approach that respects the role that teachers play in making learning relevant for every \nchild. Activities are designed to meet specific goals for social, physical, cognitive, and language \ndevelopment. As a result, children become more social: forming friendships, playing in groups, and \nlearning to get along and share with others.  \nCreative Play  \nJack & Jill Center’s Early Education Program is deeply rooted in the philosophy that children learn through \nplay. We structure our classroom environments to offer dynamic spaces to engage children’s \nimaginations. The Creative Curriculum allows children to unlock more creativity through activities such as \nsocio-dramatic play, open-ended art activities, free-choice activities, using manipulatives and puzzles. For \nexample, Unit Blocks are effective tools for children to become the architects of their space, learn the \nbasic mathematic principles of shape, proportion, physics and support, use symmetry, patterns and \ngeometry, as well as practice cooperation, persistence and self-control. These versatile wooden structures \nbecome the building blocks for higher test scores in math and science, planning and problem solving, \ncharacter development, creative socio-dramatic play, and motor coordination. Research shows that for \nevery 15 minutes of free play, 4- and 5-year-olds spend a third of their time engaged in spatial, \nmathematical, and architectural activities. Play-based learning helps children to develop initiative, self-\nregulation, prosocial behavior, language and literacy skills, math skills, memory, and symbolic thinking. \nThese skills are linked to success in school and reduced aggression."}, {"page": 6, "paragraph": 1, "text": "6 \n \nContinuity of Care  \nJack & Jill Center practices continuity of care. Continuity of care is the high-quality practice of having \nteachers and children stay together for several years, rather than having children change teachers and \ngroups of peers each year, or more frequently. Because learning occurs simultaneously with emotional \nattachment, it is best for young children to have a stable caregiver throughout their early years. Children \nand their teachers are moved up as a group into the next classroom one time a year. This practice fosters \nstrong attachment and benefits the children by giving them caregivers who know them and their parents \nwell.  \nFamily-teacher relationships are strengthened as well, as parents and teachers also have more time to get \nto know and trust one another. Within this relationship, parents are more likely to share concerns about \ntheir child, listen to the teacher’s suggestions, and learn from observing teacher-child interactions.  \nFinally, this approach allows teachers to develop and put into practice a broader understanding of child \ndevelopment as they observe it first-hand over a longer period of time than in most child care settings. \nAnecdotal evidence suggests that teachers experience greater emotional satisfaction from the longer \nrelationships with children and families, which may in turn lead to increased job retention – a critical goal \nin the field of early care and education. \nPrimary Caregiving  \nWithin the continuity of care program, Jack & Jill Center practices primary caregiving. Primary caregiving \nensures that every child has an assigned caregiver, and every parent has a primary contact. The teachers \nin each room will divide the group of children so each child has a primary caregiver. This teacher forms a \ncaring, nurturing, and responsive relationship with the child. In the classroom, s/he will be the “expert” \non their children, knowing pertinent information such as the child’s individual schedule, developmental \nabilities, special needs, sleeping habits, and individual interests  \nSpeech, Physical, and Occupational Therapy  \nJack & Jill Center’s Family Program Senior Manager assesses children who need speech, \nphysical, or occupational therapy.  Referrals are made to the Florida Diagnostic & Learning \nResources System (FDLRS) Child Find to get the child directed to the Early Steps Program \nfor complete developmental evaluations and free therapeutic services and/or special \nneeds program placements, depending on what the child qualifies for.  \nJack & Jill Center partners with Kids Spot to provide virtual and on-site speech, physical \nand occupational therapy, and with Kids in Distress to provide on-site Infant Mental \nHealth Counseling and behavioral support.

To increase fresh food access, KNOX will expand access to \ngrowing space and agricultural trainings through our Community Garden, Urban Farming, and \nEnvironmental Education programs. \n \nKNOX manages and maintains 21 community gardens throughout Hartford. Many gardens have \nunmet infrastructure needs, which limits their use. KNOX will expand access to growing space \nby installing water systems at 2 gardens, repairing water pipes at 1 garden, repairing the fence at \n2 gardens, upgrading the greenhouse at 1 garden, replacing worn out garden beds, adding \nsignage to all gardens, installing fencing around 10 garden plots, and purchasing a wood chipper \nto make woodchips for all gardens. \n \nThese infrastructure enhancements will also open up growing space for KNOX farming \nparticipants. The three-level KNOX Urban Farming Program supports a phased path on an \nindependent farming career. Goals for farming participants can include an entrepreneurial path \ntowards a farm business, a part-time project selling value-added products, or employment as \nfarmers for an established agricultural business.  \n \nKNOX will partner with Gardeners to Farmers Greenhouse and Levo International to host 6 \nagricultural workshops annually in the newly enhanced community gardens for farming \nparticipants, community gardeners, and the wider community. The workshops and infrastructure \nenhancements are in response to requests from community gardeners. \n \nAdditionally, KNOX will partner with Noah Webster Micro Society Magnet School to expand \nagricultural education for K-5 students in the KNOX Environmental Education Program. This \nprogram currently teaches students about vegetable growing and nutritious, locally grown food. \nKNOX will expand upon these efforts through a series of speaking events and field trips that \nintroduce students to careers in agriculture and innovative production. \n \nThis project will serve 300 community gardeners, 15 farming participants, 300 workshop \nattendees (100 per year), and 1,500 K-5 students (500 per year).

Project Overview: Community and the Needs to be Addressed \nHartford is a food desert with limited access to fresh, affordable food in many neighborhoods. \nThis is because many Hartford neighborhoods are located over one-half mile from a supermarket \n(USDA Economic Research Service, 2021). Another contributing factor to limited access to \nfresh food is that many households don’t have access to a vehicle. \n \nWith this funding, KNOX will increase fresh food access in Hartford by expanding access to \ngrowing space and agricultural trainings through our Community Garden, Urban Farming, and \nEnvironmental Education programs. \n \nKNOX manages and maintains 21 community gardens located across 10 low-to-moderate \nincome Hartford neighborhoods, providing residents with access to growing space close to their \nhomes. These gardens span 9.87 acres. KNOX provides regular maintenance of the community \ngardens, including mowing and litter removal, as well as access to seeds and compost. \n \nMany community gardens have unmet infrastructure needs, limiting their use. KNOX will \nexpand access to growing space by installing water systems at 2 gardens that lack water access, \nrepairing water pipes at 1 garden, repairing fences at 2 gardens to protect produce, installing \nfencing around 10 plots to keep out animals, purchasing a wood chipper to improve garden \nmaintenance, and adding signage to all 21 gardens to raise awareness of their availability. KNOX \nwill also upgrade the greenhouse at 1 garden by installing new sidewalls, roofing, vents, and a \ndoor, and updating the flooring and heating system for increased efficiency and productivity. The \ngreenhouse walls and door are heavily stained and cracked, and do not let in sufficient light. The \ngreenhouse roof traps in water, and vents do not open, preventing fresh air from entering. KNOX \nwill also replace worn out lumber garden beds with double stacked composite beds, which last \n25-30 years, while the lumber KNOX currently uses lasts 3-7 years (Trex, 2022). Community \ngardeners have requested double stacked beds for enhanced accessibility with less bending to \nseed, weed, and harvest. By meeting these needs, KNOX will increase the number of community \ngardeners from 253 to 300 annually, increasing fresh food access for Hartford families. \n \nMeeting community garden infrastructure needs will also open up growing space for KNOX’s 15 \nfarming participants, specifically for levels 2 and 3 participants to make progress on their \npersonal farm-based business growth. The three-level Urban Farming Program supports a phased \npath on an independent farming career. Goals for participants can include an entrepreneurial path \ntowards a farm business, a part-time project selling value-added products, or employment as \nfarmers for an established farm business. KNOX provides access to growing space, water, \nagricultural education, and training with experts in various growing techniques. Participants sell \ntheir produce to local organizations, including Hartford Public Schools Lunch Program. \n \nThis funding will also expand agricultural education for approximately 500 K-5 students \nannually in the KNOX Environmental Education Program. Typically, students learn about \nvegetable growing and the importance of eating nutritious, locally grown food, including"}, {"page": 3, "paragraph": 1, "text": "2 \n \nproduce farming participants provide for school lunches. KNOX will expand upon these efforts \nthrough a series of speaking events and field trips that introduce students to careers in agriculture \nand innovative production.

Each year, KNOX will host 6 agricultural \nworkshops in the newly enhanced community gardens that engage at least 100 attendees. \n \nThis project will serve Hartford, Connecticut. The population is 120,576 (United States Census \nBureau, 2021). A staggering 28.1% of Hartford residents live in poverty compared to 10.4% of \nConnecticut residents (TownCharts, 2021). Hartford's median household income is $36,278 \ncompared to $78,833 in Connecticut, and 16.3% of families have no one working. Hartford City \nPlan (2020) and Hartford Climate Action Plan (2020) emphasize the need to improve the local \nfood economy through urban agriculture. City of Hartford Advisory Commission on Food Policy \n(2020) also recommends the use of urban agriculture to increase access to fresh, local food. \n \nTarget areas are low-income and low food access census tracts. 18 community gardens are in \nlow-income tracts (FFIEC, 2020). 5 community gardens are also in low food access tracts, and 5 \nare in Qualified Opportunity Zones (USDA Economic Research Service, 2021; LISC, 2019). In \nEarle Garden’s tract, 34.7% of households don’t have vehicles and are over one-half mile from a \nsupermarket (USDA Economic Research Service, 2021). Noah Webster Micro Society Magnet \nSchool is also in a low-income and low food access tract. \n \nThis project will serve 300 community gardeners, 15 farming participants, 300 workshop \nattendees (100 per year), and 1,500 K-5 students (500 per year). It will also serve thousands of \nHartford families and children by increasing access to fresh food grown by community gardeners \nand farming participants. As a 2021 Fall Quest Task Force Survey of KNOX community \ngardeners found, 65% share produce, 57% grow for primary use, and 34% donate produce. We \nestimate those we serve reflect Hartford's population, which includes 45% Latinx, 37% Black, \n15% White, and 3% Asian (TownCharts, 2021).

This project will also promote environmental justice by \naddressing inadequate access to fresh food, providing access to community gardens that promote \nhealth, and teaching sustainable agricultural practices that reduce pollution. Hartford has high \nrisk of lead paint exposure and lung cancer compared to surrounding areas, and many Hartford \nneighborhoods have asthma rates up to 13.5% (DataHaven, 2021).  \n \nThis project has the potential to mitigate the impacts caused by climate change. By increasing \naccess to locally grown food, this project will reduce the distance food travels, which will \ndecrease air pollution from food transportation. Alarmingly, fruits and vegetables travel 1,500 \nmiles on average to reach consumers, burning about 500 gallons of diesel fuel per trip (South \nUniversity, 2016). To further mitigate climate change impacts, KNOX prohibits use of \npetroleum-based fertilizers and pesticides in the community gardens, farm plots, and school \ngardens. The agricultural workshops KNOX hosts will include topics on organic and sustainable \nfarming practices, such as companion planting and legacy crops. \n \n2.

Workplan and Activities to Achieve the Goals: \nAs Hartford is a food desert with limited access to fresh food, expanding food production is vital. \nFarming participants and community gardeners face barriers to expanding food production due to \nlimited access to growing space. To fill this need, our project goals include expanding access to \ngrowing space for farming participants and community gardeners by meeting infrastructure \nneeds of KNOX’s 21 community gardens. To meet this goal, we included objectives of installing \nwater systems at Dart and Winter Green gardens, repairing water pipes at Laurel Garden, \nrepairing the fences at Enfield and Good Shepherd gardens, and providing upgrades to Battles \nGarden’s greenhouse. Community gardeners requested these enhancements. \n \nTo further expand food production, we’ve included the goal of delivering agricultural training \nopportunities to farming participants, community gardeners, and the wider community.

As community gardeners and farming \nparticipants will grow food in the community gardens for years to come, this project will impact \nHartford well beyond the grant period. This project will provide KNOX with the framework to \ncontinue agricultural workshops and K-5 agricultural education beyond the grant period. This \nproject will advance UAIP goals of developing urban agriculture and innovative production \nactivities in an urban area with limited fresh food access. Farming participants will continue to \nsell produce to local organizations using knowledge they learned. \n \nPotential funding sources to support continuation of this project after the grant period are \nConnecticut Department of Agriculture ($19,300), Farm Aid ($7,500), Gawlicki Family \nFoundation ($75,000 over 3 years), Hartford Foundation for Public Giving ($16,290), William \nCaspar Graustein Memorial Fund ($2,500), Farm Credit Northeast AgEnhancement ($5,000), \nPrice Chopper ($500), Red Sox Foundation ($1,000), Robert F. Schumann Foundation ($210,000 \nover 3 years), ShopRite ($2,000), State Farm ($8,000), TD Charitable Foundation ($5,000), and \nWalmart Foundation ($1,000), from all of which we have recently received funding at the listed \namounts to support the Community Garden, Urban Farming, and Environmental Education \nprograms. KNOX also has deep corporate relationships from which we will continue to seek \nfunding. KNOX charges $20 to $30 per community garden plot to support the program. KNOX \nwill also offer agricultural workshops to non-Hartford residents for a fee to help cover costs. \n \nKNOX partnerships promote sustainability of our programs overall. Hands on Hartford provides \ncommercial kitchen access, Farm Credit East and reSET provide business trainings, and \nMicro2Life and Red, Green, and Gold LLC provide innovative urban farming trainings to \nfarming participants.

However, lit-\ntle is known about the effectiveness of the reentry programs for young people and recidivism \nrates for juvenile justice continue to be as high as 75%.2 In 2015, the Office of Juvenile Justice \nand Delinquency Prevention, (OJJDP) Office of Justice Programs, US Department of Justice, \nlaunched two juvenile justice data improvement programs to identify reentry and best practice \ndata to better understand what helps young people succeed after system involvement. The Initia-\ntive to Develop Juvenile Reentry Measurement Standards (RS) project was awarded to the Per-\nformance-based Standards Learning Institute, Inc. (PbS), and the Juvenile Justice Model Data \nProject (MDP) was awarded to the National Center for Juvenile Justice (NCJJ), the research divi-\nsion of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges (NCJFCJ). In 2018, OJJDP \nlaunched a subsequent data improvement project to further that work: Improving Juvenile \nReentry Programs’ Capacity for Reentry Data Collection, Analysis and Reporting. OJJDP se-\nlected PbS with partners NCJJ to provide training and technical assistance to build local capaci-\nties and increase the collection and use of the reentry data identified by the two 2015 data im-\nprovement programs. \nThe projects showed juvenile justice agencies struggle to collect, analyze and utilize \nreentry data, leading to ineffective decision-making and hindering positive reentry outcomes for \nyoung people.

Positive youth development (PYD) redirects juvenile justice professionals to con-\ncentrate on practices that recognize and promote each young person’s ability to thrive. The PYD \napproach also makes clear the need to expand beyond recidivism as a single measure of program \neffectiveness.6  \n \nJuvenile justice leaders are recognizing the need to address the challenges young people \nface when they leave the structure and control of confinement, challenges which are largely a re-\nsult of their system involvement.

Our mission is to create pathways out of poverty and advance a green economy through\ninclusive financial services. Since 2009, we have financed over 9,100 small-dollar personal loans\ntotalling $19.5 million (with a 95% repayment rate) and graduated more than 1,800 Financial Coaching\nclients. As a social justice organization, we believe in the vision of Dr. Muhammad Yunus, the 2006\nNobel Peace Prize Winner: to \"put poverty into museums\" through microfinance.\nAndy Posner founded Good Fund in 2009 after completing his M.A. in Environmental Studies at Brown\nUniversity. Headquartered in Rhode Island, our 42-person staff serves families throughout the states of\nRhode Island, Florida, Massachusetts, Delaware, Illinois, Colorado, Texas, and most recently,\nConnecticut and New Jersey. We’re an alternative to the $200 billion predatory financial industry\nconsisting of payday lenders, pawnshops, auto-title lenders, and more; in TX, payday lenders do nearly\n$6 billion in volume, with average interest rates over 600%. Our clients are low-income; predominantly\nof color and female; and shut out of the financial mainstream due to issues related to income, race,\ngender, credit, immigration status, and language barriers. We strive to empower vulnerable families to\nsave, build credit, invest in themselves, avoid high-interest debt, and achieve their goals, while also\nforcing predatory lenders to lower their rates--or close up shop.\nWe’re one of the few nonprofit CDFIs nationwide--or in Texas--that specializes in small-dollar personal\nloans. Our loans range from $300-$60,000 and are used for a variety of purposes, including\nimmigration expenses; repairing a vehicle; emergencies and crisis relief; security deposits; and\nrenewable energy and energy-efficiency upgrades for homeowners unable to access credit from\ntraditional lenders. Our nationally-recognized Financial & Health Coaching program includes sessions\non banking, budgeting, credit, debt, savings, and health. Taken together, our products and services play\nan important role in the Credit as An Asset Movement, which recognizes that access to equitable\nfinancial services is crucial to the resiliency of low-income families, empowering them to reduce the\nstress of financial instability and begin to move into the financial mainstream.\nCapital Good Fund continues to receive tremendous local and national press coverage from publications\nsuch as the Wall Street Journal, Fortune Magazine, Forbes Magazine, NPR, CNBC, Dallas Business\nJournal, and KERA News, among other print, radio, and TV outlets.

Funding will enable us to finance 120 Crisis\nRelief Loans to low- to moderate-income families throughout the state of Texas during the one-year\ngrant period.\nThe Need\nTwo years into the pandemic and COVID-19 continues to impact the health and finances of Texas\nfamilies, particularly among communities of color, veterans, immigrants, persons with disabilities, and\nthe “working poor”: people living paycheck-to-paycheck, working multiple jobs to get by, and lacking\nliquidity in the form of savings, home equity, social capital, or access to affordable credit. The financial\ndevastation wrought by the pandemic in Texas is clear: according to the U.S. Census Bureau's\nHousehold Pulse Survey, 41% of families that are not current on their rent or mortgage feel that eviction\nis likely in the next month; 20% are behind on their utility bills; 12% report not having enough food to\neat; and nearly 36% report difficulty paying for usual monthly household expenses. The Episcopal\nHealth Foundation found that 49% of Texas families report that the pandemic has caused financial\nhardship for them, including 16% who said it caused severe financial suffering. The study found that\nBIPOC families were more likely to report financial hardship, including 59% of Hispanic/Latinx and\n45% African-American/Black households in Texas, compared to 42% of white households.\nHispanic/Latinx families born outside of the United States were the hardest hit, with over 71% reporting\nfinancial hardship.\nThese alarming statistics demonstrate that economically vulnerable Texas families, including BIPOC\nfamilies, female-headed households, and immigrants, need access to capital to smooth over temporary\ncash-flow issues and address pressing needs, yet the inability to secure equitable credit has left them\nwith few options; often, they turn to high-interest debt such as payday loans, which carry over a 600%\nAPR in Texas. Our Crisis Relief Loan program is an equitable solution that provides transparent,\ncredit-building capital liquidity to families who have been historically shut out of financial opportunity\nbecause of generations of systemic racism to cover critical expenses, address the lingering impacts of\nCOVID-19, and enter the financial mainstream.\nThe Crisis Relief Loan\nIn early April 2020, we launched the Crisis Relief Loan (“CRL”) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCrisis Relief Loans range from $300 - $1,500 at just 5% APR (fixed) and feature a 15-month term, the\nfirst three of which are a deferment period. CRLs are used for key needs such as catching up on\npast-due rent or utilities; nutritious food; vehicle repair; technology purchases; medical and dental\ncosts; paying off high-interest predatory debt; critical monthly bills; and other purchases to keep them\nafloat as the pandemic continues.\n333 Smith Street, Providence, RI 02908 | 866-584-3651 (P) | 866-254-0219 (F) | www.GoodFund.us\nCapital Good Fund is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization"}, {"page": 3, "paragraph": 1, "text": "Our program offers many consumer-first features, including flexible underwriting based on a holistic\nreview of the applicant's financial picture; no application, prepayment, or late penalties or fees; no\nminimum income or FICO score requirement; available to families regardless of immigration status;\nand reported to the three main credit bureaus. Crisis Relief Loan applications can be accessed 24/7 via\nour convenient online portal. Crucially, all client-facing staff, including our Dallas-based Loan Officer,\nare fluent in Spanish and our website, loan application, and closing documents are available in both\nEnglish and native-translated Spanish.\nSince launching the program, we have financed over\nCrisis Relief Loans for more than $\nmillion across our footprint. Texas represents nearly\n% of our CRL portfolio, where we have closed\nover\nloans for more than $\n. With many more applications currently under review, we\ncontinue to see a significant need for the CRL program in Texas.\nTarget Population\nOur clients are lower-income and/or low-wealth, predominantly of color, and female, with a significant\npercent being immigrants. Those we serve are traditionally shut out of the financial mainstream due to\nissues related to income, race, gender, credit, disability, immigration status, language, and mistrust of\nthe financial system. Nearly\n% of our Texas CRL clients identify as female;\n;\n% were extremely low-income (less than 30% of Area Median Income);\n% very low-income (49-30% AMI); and\n% low-income (79-50% AMI). The majority of the\nremaining\n% were “Asset-Limited, Income-Constrained, and Employed” (ALICE): those above the\npoverty line but living paycheck-to-paycheck. While we will serve all of Texas with this funding, the\nmajority of our existing Texas clients reside in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Bryan, and El Paso. We\nanticipate serving clients with similar demographics during this grant period.\nGoals and Objectives\nOur goal is to help families navigate the financial challenges the pandemic has presented by providing\naffordable capital to those who need it most: low- to moderate-income Texas families trying to build\npathways toward a stable financial future, whether that be a loan to catch up on rent or past-due\nutilities, food, monthly bills, and as we have seen increasingly, security deposits for domestic violence\nvictims in need of safe housing.\nAt less than $34 in interest for a $1,000 loan, the CRL’s 5% APR puts cost-saving capital directly into\nthe pockets of low-income Texas families with poor or no credit—a population that struggles to access\nfinancial services from mainstream lenders. Not only does the CRL replace predatory products like\npayday loans, they also decrease reliance on credit cards, which currently average an APR of over 20%.\nTo maximize the credit-building component of the CRL,\n. Since we report to the major credit bureaus, on-time payments have significant impacts on\ncredit health, thus setting a foundation for financial stability while addressing immediate needs.\n333 Smith Street, Providence, RI 02908 | 866-584-3651 (P) | 866-254-0219 (F) | www.GoodFund.us\nCapital Good Fund is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization"}, {"page": 4, "paragraph": 1, "text": "Major Events and Project Activities\nMajor events and activities for this grant period will include:\n●\nContinue performing outreach to agencies throughout Texas to grow our network of community\npartners.\n●\nProcess inquiries and applications for Crisis Relief Loans via phone, email, and online website\nchats and finance CRLs on a rolling basis as applications are reviewed and approved.\n●\nProvide wraparound support for Texas families as needed, including providing resources,\nfinancial coaching, and referrals to our community partners.\n●\nSchedule client check-ins at 6- and 12-months post-intake to measure social impact outcomes\nfor all clients served. Because clients are enrolled for the program on a rolling basis as\napplications are received, the timing for scheduling the remaining check-ins is dependent on the\nclients’ intake dates.\nOutcomes and Measures of Success\nAs a mission-driven organization, measuring our impact is critical to ensuring we meet our goals and\nidentifying ways to further our mission. As part of our iterative process, we administer client surveys\nthat measure progress across a multitude of domains, such as income, banking status, predatory\nfinancial service usage, budgeting, financial well-being, and physical and mental well-being. These\nsurveys, which include validated survey instruments such as the Consumer Financial Protection\nBureau's Financial Wellness Scale and the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module, are\nadministered at two weeks following loan closing to establish a baseline for each client. Borrowers will\nalso be asked to complete these surveys at six months and twelve months following loan closing to track\nchanges in their overall wellbeing. During the intake process, we collect information on the prospective\nloan purpose to measure the use and impact of our loans.\nWe will also conduct soft credit pulls at twelve months post-closing as well as at the end of the loan term\nto track changes in FICO score. We will measure savings in interest and fees over a predatory lender\nthrough comparative analysis of predatory financial products of the same size. Furthermore, because\nour programs are shaped by client feedback, we will monitor customer satisfaction, particularly through\nGoogle Review ratings. We currently hold a 4.7 out of 5-star rating with nearly 360 reviews. We will\ntrack the following outcomes for the 120 clients served during this grant period:\n●\nSavings: clients will save an average of $700 versus a comparable predatory loan product such\nas a payday loan, for a cumulative total of $84,000, as measured through a comparative analysis\nof predatory financial products of the same size.\n●\nCredit: clients will see an average FICO credit score increase of 75 points by the end of their loan\nterms.\n●\nRelieve significant financial stress: absent our program, it is possible that our clients will face\nhunger, eviction, harmed credit, utility shutoffs, or worse. The CRL’s three month deferment\nperiod also gives families breathing room to start to recover before making any payments.\n333 Smith Street, Providence, RI 02908 | 866-584-3651 (P) | 866-254-0219 (F) | www.GoodFund.us\nCapital Good Fund is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization"}, {"page": 5, "paragraph": 1, "text": "Partnerships and Collaboration\nWhile there is no formal partnership associated with this specific grant request, we collaborate with\nmany organizations throughout Texas to create a reciprocal referral network that allows us to\nholistically meet the needs of families and build trust within the community. Some of our partners\ninclude United Way of Metropolitan Dallas, Texas Muslim Women’s Foundation, Bonton Farms, RAISE\nTexas, Texas Appleseed, Services of Hope, Harmony Community Development Corporation, and the\nCatholic Charities of Fort Worth.

Within just three months of receiving the generous\nfunding, we met our proposed goals and financed 120 Crisis Relief Loans to low- to moderate-income\nTexas families. Since the average household size to which we lend consists of 3 people, we estimate that\nwe reached 360 individuals with the previous grant. We anticipate easily meeting or exceeding our goals\nonce again with this funding.\nConclusion\nWe envision an inclusive Texas in which all families, especially historically marginalized communities,\nhave access to safe, affordable, and transparent credit that enables them to weather significant financial\nshocks caused by the pandemic and quickly recover from them. Our role is to promote financial\ninclusion through our critical and innovative program with the long-term goal of improving the\neconomic stability of low- to moderate-income Texas families.

However, as the crime rate and poverty continue to dramatically rise \nin its already distressed service area, exacerbated by the devastating effects of COVID-19 on the \nlocal economy and unemployment, there is a corresponding sharp increase in the number of \nhomeless youth requesting services, and a reported decrease in individual donations and private \nfoundation funding to support crisis services. \n \nSVHC, a registered nonprofit, distinguishes itself from other agencies serving at-risk youth by \nproviding behavioral health services as a key element of its program. SVHC’s location in the \nmunicipality of Normandy, centered in North St. Louis County, provides a safe haven for at-risk \nyouth in these distressed communities characterized by low-performing or unaccredited schools, \nand with significant economic and social challenges. \n \nSVHC’s Transitional Living Program (TLP) will assist 39 youth aged 16-under 22 from St. \nLouis City and St. Louis County over the course of the 3 years of the project, who are working to \ntransition into self-sufficiency and permanent housing. The TLP will follow a trauma-informed, \nstrengths-based model, which includes relevant, youth-centered, evidence-based practices, an \narray of collaborations and partnerships, continuous quality improvement, and strong \nperformance measures and evaluation. TLP staff, consisting of Therapists, Case Managers, Life \nSkills Coach, Youth Leadership Specialist and Youth Development Specialists will provide a \ntiered housing approach for runaway and homeless youth, utilizing a communal setting and \ntransitioning to a semi-independent, apartment-style setting once progress towards goals are \nevident. Services provided by the team will include individual and group therapy, mentoring, \nsupport with educational attainment, supported employment, life skills instruction, and assistance \nto transition to permanent housing. TLP therapists will apply the practices of Cognitive Behavior \nTherapy (CBT), Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), and Solution- \nFocused Brief Therapy (SFBT) to help youth process trauma and other adverse experiences."}, {"page": 4, "paragraph": 1, "text": "Need for Assistance \n1.1 Need for TLP Assistance \nOver its 172-year history, SVHC Home for Children (SVHC) has evolved from an orphanage \nand school to an agency equipped to address the mental health and community needs of youth \nand their families.

Therefore, if SVHC does not receive RHY funding, the \nmost devastated and impoverished sector of the St. Louis Metropolitan Area, which is North \nCounty, will continue to see a rise of youth living on the streets, which would undoubtedly add \ntrafficking, violence, and substance use disorder to the factors of existing high-crime, lower- \nincome, and disparities in access to services.

The \nYouth Enrollment & Community Engagement Coordinator is responsible for verifying the \nhomelessness information provided by the youth. SVHC’s CWSIS Admission Profile gathers \ndemographic information, key issues, behaviors and concerns, and interactions with schools and \nother agencies. If the youth is determined to meet basic eligibility requirements, an interview is \nscheduled with a clinician and a member of the Supportive Housing team. The interview is \ndesigned to enable the youth and SVHC staff to determine if the TLP is the right fit for the \nyouth.

No other local TLP devotes so much of its program resources to therapy. \n \nPhase 3 of the visioning process is fund development, which will begin in July 2022. \nWith the identification of TLP as a priority focus, SVHC has already begun its efforts to \ndiversify funding sources for the program. SVHC expects to receive confirmation of a \n \n contract for TLP in the next couple of weeks and has several proposals \npending with local foundations for TLP support. SVHC already receives significant support from \nthe \n for TLP, and \n recently approved the \nexpansion of the program from 90 days to 18 months. SVHC hopes to identify other potential \nfunding sources through the fund development process. In addition to these sources of support, \nSVHC benefits from well-publicized and established fundraising events, including the annual \n“Kookin’ For Kids” event, which generates approximately \nin revenue each year. Staff \nretention: SVHC will assure sustainability of the TLP program through staff training of key \nevidence-based practices and the core competencies of youth workers, frameworks to promote \ncompliance, and stakeholder engagement to promote and verify relevance and cultural \nresponsiveness. As with each of SVHC’s programs, TLP will complement and support the tenets \nof youth and family strengthening that lead to self-sufficiency outcomes and positive trajectories \nin educational attainment, employment, and improved Social Determinants of Health. \nDemonstrating results and accountability in meeting FYSB’s TLP performance standards: SVHC \nwill continue to demonstrate results and accountability in meeting FYSB’s TLP performance"}, {"page": 48, "paragraph": 1, "text": "standards through ongoing involvement in the local CoCs; continuing contracts and audits by \n and \n and reporting to its various funders, including \n \n.

The advertising included in the project budget is a part of \nthis effort. \n \nSVHC benefits from several local businesses, churches, and schools which donate \nessential and supportive items for youth, such as personal supplies, clothing, winter wear, shoes, \nsocks, school supplies, birthday, and holiday gifts. Interaction with the St. Louis County and City \nCoCs and participating agencies, as well as SVHC’s growing list of service partners, will raise \ncommunity awareness of the TLP. Maintaining partnerships with other service agencies: SVHC \nactively seeks partnerships with companies, organizations, and individuals in the community, \nthrough which volunteer assets and contributions help offset program costs and provide real-\nworld information and experiences to assist youth with life skills development. For example, \nexperts from the business community are invited to work with program staff to host classes that \neducate youth on a variety of topics, such as financial education (e.g., beginner level introduction \nto financial literacy).

Therefore, we project that this model guarantees improved access to previously unmet \nhealthcare needs in our Charlotte communities. \n \nThe continuum of patient care and collaboration between healthcare partnerships is emphasized in this \nproposal. For the success of this project, the primary concerns that this proposal will address: \n• \nAccess to medical care for the uninsured 200% or below the poverty level. \n• \nImproved healthcare access to mitigate location and public transportation barriers. \n• \nPrimary care, Semi Urgent, Wellness, Specialty, and Pharmacy needs. \n• \nPublic Health needs. \n• \nMental/ behavioral/substance-abuse needs. \n• \nThe need to transition patients to our VBA Standing Medical Clinic site. \n \nVBA will also demonstrate the importance of the Mobile Medical Clinic through the following: \n \n1.

Layout a budget with detailed justification. \n \n1) Current Need of Mobile Services \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has pushed healthcare systems to its limits. As our population’s health needs \ncontinue to evolve, health care must turn to innovative models to meet those needs equitably and \nsustainably. \n \nLimited access to health care affects tens of millions of Americans daily. Most of the affected populations \nare identified as transportation disadvantaged, meaning persons who are unable to transport themselves or \npurchase transportation due to physical or mental disability, income status, or age. \n \nUnmet health-related needs for these vulnerable populations include lack of transportation to and from \nhealth education, mental health and substance abuse programs, dialysis centers, follow-up visits, medical \ntesting, and other health care services. \n \nMobile health clinics can play an important part and reduce health disparities, especially among vulnerable \npopulations, those with chronic illness, and rural communities without easy access to healthcare facilities. \n \nFor some people, mobile health clinics are the only means to lifesaving medical treatment. For many, access \nto affordable health care may not be possible without mobile clinic services.

(Patient Access News / Thinkstock 2018). \n \nAcross the country, patients living in health deserts suffer from limited care access and other socioeconomic \nbarriers to healthcare. But mobile health clinics are changing that, driving better patient access to care by \npulling right into a patient’s neighborhood. \n \nMobile health clinics have become common tools for health systems working to reach their otherwise \nunreachable patient populations. According to a 2017 report from the Advisory Board, patients report \nnumerous barriers to accessing care: \n \n• \n50% of low-income adults do not trust healthcare. \n• \n20% are deterred by high healthcare costs. \n• \n25% percent lack transportation to medical appointments. \n• \n11 % lack insurance coverage. \n• \nOthers report social isolation, racial or economic barriers, or language and cultural barriers. \n \nHealthcare organizations designed mobile health clinics to meet these patients’ needs. The clinics show up \nin a patient’s neighborhood, making the experience a little more trustworthy and convenient, according to \nBridget Wicks, a nurse practitioner who works in a mobile health clinic for North Country HealthCare in \nFlagstaff, Arizona. “I’m able to see them right there in the parking lot,” Wicks said in a \nprevious interview with HealthIntelligence.com. “It is a comforting environment. It is a secure environment \nfor them, and so they are open to you.” \n \nResearch corroborates that anecdote. A 2017 literature review published in the International Journal for \nEquity in Health noted that mobile health clinics make an unfamiliar healthcare environment more familiar \nby being located right in a patient’s neighborhood."}, {"page": 7, "paragraph": 1, "text": "New Mobile Medical Clinic ~ A Proposal \nPage 7 of 22 \n \n \n“Qualitative research has found that patients value mobile health clinics informal setting, familiar \nenvironment, convenient location, and staff who are easy to talk to,” the literature review authors explained. \n“Because mobile health clinics make the effort to physically drive into communities, they feel that the \nclinics are reaching out to care about them, inspiring them to take charge of their health.” \n \nMobile health clinics are making their mark on healthcare, the Advisory Board reported. Currently, there \nare about 2,000 mobile health clinics on the road. The average operational cost of these clinics is $429,000 \nannually. And with 6.5 million mobile health clinic visits each year, return on investment is $12 per patient. \n \nThe Advisory Board report added, Healthcare organizations hosting mobile health clinics are not just saving \nmoney; they are also making a dent in the most vulnerable, safety-net patient populations. 60% of the \npatients visiting mobile health clinics are uninsured, and another 31% have insurance. \n \nMost of these clinics focus on preventive care (45%) and primary care (42%). 30% of mobile health clinics \nalso provide dental care. But how effective are mobile health clinics? How sustainable are they in the current \nhealthcare landscape? \n \nBelow, PatientEngagementHIT.com discusses the benefits and challenges of mobile health clinics and how \nthey can fit into healthcare organizations’ primary acre footprints. \n \nHow Effective Are Mobile Clinics? As the healthcare industry seeks to reduce care disparities, address the \nsocial determinants of health, and promote value-based care, mobile health clinics have served to fill in the \ngaps. These vehicle-based clinics have proven extremely effective at connecting high-risk patients with \nprimary and preventive care. \n \nData included in the International Journal of Equity in Health literature review showed that mobile health \nclinics have made it easier for patients to access the appropriate type of care. \n \nIndustry experts often look at emergency department (ED) utilization rates to understand the overall health \nof a region. When ED utilization rates are excessive, experts can conclude that there are critical primary \ncare needs in a community. Research included in the literature review found that visits from a mobile health \nclinic reduced ED costs and utilization. \n \nIn other communities, mobile health clinics have led to lower readmission rates, more symptom-free days, \nand better patient reports of quality of life. \n \nMobile health clinics are also good at delivering on value-based care. Because these clinics focus on \npreventive and primary care, they can detect at-risk individuals and begin health interventions early, \nincreasing the likelihood of recovery and reducing eventual health costs."}, {"page": 8, "paragraph": 1, "text": "New Mobile Medical Clinic ~ A Proposal \nPage 8 of 22 \n \n \n“Because mobile clinics can successfully reduce barriers in access to healthcare, mobile health clinics \nprovide more opportunities for underserved populations to screen for various conditions and learn to \nproperly manage their health,” the literature review authors said. \n \nMobile health clinics can also be effective at improving chronic disease management, the literature review \nauthors explained. “The challenge of chronic disease management is sustaining adherence to the necessary \nmedications and lifestyle changes, and quantitative evidence from multiple mobile health clinics signify \nthat mobile clinics are effective in helping patients address these challenges,” they wrote. \n \nThis is because mobile health clinics come to patients and make it easier for them to engage with their \nhealthcare providers. For example, one study showed that mobile health clinics reduced LDL in high blood \npressure patients because patients received more support in self-management and gave patients a regular \nplace for treatment access. \n \nSome studies suggest that patients who visit mobile health clinics can also increase their health literacy, \nmaking it easier and more empowering for them to manage their own health. One of the studies included in \nthe literature review found that patients were 78% more likely to self-manage their conditions after visiting \na mobile health clinic. \n \nWhat Are the Challenges of Mobile Clinics? Mobile health clinics are not a panacea. While clinics can be \neffective at closing care gaps, addressing the social determinants of health, and promoting health equity, \nthey do have shortcomings. \n \nRegarding our VBA New Mobile Medical Clinic Project, VBA has addressed the following challenges of \nmobile clinics to support the financial sustainability and continuum of quality care for all patients. \n \n• \nThe Business Goal of the Mobile Medical Clinic. \n \nOur VBA goal is to improve the health status of diverse and most in need uninsured communities \nthroughout Charlotte County. The VBA Mobile Medical Clinic will successfully break down barriers due \nto the recent COVID-19 pandemic serving Charlotte County between the uninsured access to healthcare, \nand ultimately providing patients with a standing medical clinic for ongoing healthcare services. \nFurthermore, all services will be provided at no cost to patients. \nThis enhanced model will allow our Mobile Medical Clinic to serve a variety of populations across \nCharlotte County, while simultaneously removing financial barriers that can hinder patients’ access to \nhealthcare. Therefore, we project that this model guarantees improved access to previously unmet healthcare \nneeds in our Charlotte communities. \nProgram reports will be collected monthly to include updates of program data summary and reporting \nmeasures. A final report for the startup funding and beyond will conclude the effort. All reports will be \nsubmitted to the Board of County Commissioners within the required timeframe.

Girls and gender-diverse\nyouth are not getting the proper messages in their lives to succeed and become leaders\nbecause so few women and gender-diverse people are involved in the production of\nthose messages.\nThe opportunity to train at WAM’s professional recording studios, surrounded by the\nlatest technology, is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the students we serve. WAM\nprograms attract and recruit youth with a wide array of arts programming including\nmusic, songwriting, video games, podcasts and coding. The strength of GotM is that it\ncaters to both those interested in performance and those interested in\nbehind-the-scenes production. Students receive hands-on experience making all of the\nmedia they regularly consume: music, podcasts, film soundtracks, etc. The program\nprovides wrap-around support with dedicated near-peer mentors and provides\nopportunities for exposure to new careers and invaluable training and experience.\nOne student shared that “I came to WAM with no music experience and I learned so\nmuch over my time at WAM and now I think I found my new passion. Thank you!”\nIt is WAM’s goal to provide access to creative opportunities to as many under-resourced\nstudents as possible.\n2. Describe how the project design provides for safe, healthy, and appropriate\nlearning environments for the youth participants.\nGotM has been serving under-resourced youth for over 19 years, removing economic\nbarriers to music and media arts training by delivering free classes that center and\namplify the voices of girls and gender-diverse youth.

WAM’s\ninstructors receive regular culturally responsive education training from the SF\nDepartment of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF). Our program and instructors are\nevaluated annually by DCYF, ensuring quality instruction and an environment that\nfosters belonging. All instructors undergo district required Livescan background checks\nand TB Testing.\nWAM’s reputation as a safe haven for girls/gender-diverse youth is evidenced by\nfeedback we receive from students, care-givers and school partners. One parent called\nWAM a “vital lifeline” for her daughter and a teacher shared: “Students who had been\ndisengaged for much of the year came alive during the music lessons with y'all. In their\nend of semester reflections, many wrote about WAM being the highlight of their fall\nsemester back to in-person classes… it was awesome to have y'all come in each week,\nwith a fun lesson and human-power for the students to get the direct support they\ndeserve.”\n3. Describe how the artistic and/or cultural providers will measure the artistic and\ndevelopmental outcomes of the youth participants.\nThe primary tools for measuring artistic and developmental outcomes of participants:\n●\nOutside evaluation via Youth Program Quality Assessment (YPQA), an\nevidence-based assessment program used across many school districts.\nEducation specialists from SF Department of Children, Youth, Families assess\nstudent engagement through observation of instructors and classes, review of\nlesson plans and interviews with instructional staff and students.\n●\nOne-to-one interviews with students via instructors and mentors\n●\nPre/post program evaluation surveys with students\n●\nReview of completed student projects\n●\nMeetings with partner school program directors\nThese evaluation tools allow WAM to measure student learning outcomes compared to\nthe National Media Arts/California Performing Arts Standards and collect the following\ndata – the number of girls/gender-diverse youth that:"}, {"page": 14, "paragraph": 1, "text": "●\nSuccessfully complete a cycle of training.\n●\nCreate an original music/media project\n●\nPresent or perform their project at a WAM open mic or school/family showcase.\n●\nReport that they have gained music, media, storytelling or creative expression\nskills\n●\nReport knowing about creative music/media careers they did not know about\nbefore.\n●\nPublish their projects online or share projects via mobile devices.\nWe also track participants’ demographics and native language, ensuring that we have\nadequate bilingual staff; pre/post program enrollment in music or media classes;\ninstructional hours delivered, and the number of new school partners served and\ngeographic reach.\nStudent feedback is critical. One student shared “Coming out of your program, I see\nmusic in a whole other way that I really wanted to learn: as a songwriter and producer!\nThe welcoming and supportive environment you’ve provided has been so impactful for\nme as a young musician. What Felicia said about my singing will stick with me…that\nwas the first time I’ve ever heard encouragement for my voice and you have no idea\nwhat it meant to me.”\n4. Describe how your project design and implementation reflects a commitment\nto include and represent the communities to be served.\nWAM specifically partners with schools/students from the most under-resourced\ncommunities in Northern California and under-represented in the music industry. GoTM\nintentionally centers girls/gender-diverse youth because of the chronic gender inequity\nand representation in the music industry. Only 2-3% of music producers and 12% of\nBillboard-charting songwriters are women or gender-diverse artists according to the\nlatest USC Annenberg study and far fewer are BIPOC.\nMore than 90% of WAM students are BIPOC and 96% come from low-income\ncommunities. The GotM program is free to all youth to remove economic barriers.\nWAM prioritizes hiring local BIPOC teaching artists who are from the communities we\nserve and has developed an exceptional instructional team that is led by 100% BIPOC\nwomen/gender/diverse artists with 88% BIPOC instructors. This ensures that our\ncurriculum is led and created by artists from the communities we serve.\nInstructors are highly trained in creating culturally-responsive curriculum and facilitating\nyouth co-creation of course objectives and project topics.
