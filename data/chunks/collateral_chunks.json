With help \nfrom our supporters, the Capital Area Food Bank works in partnership with people and organizations across the region to \nprovide over 50 million nutritious meals to our neighbors in need each year. Here\u2019s a closer look at how we do it!\nPANTRY\nCAFB SOURCES FOOD: CAFB procures the food for \ntens of millions of nutritious meals from grocers, growers, \nwholesalers, and government sources. \n1\n3\nFOOD IS SENT INTO OUR COMMUNITY: After being prepared by \nvolunteers and operations team members, food is ready to be sent into our \ncommunity. Some of it is picked up by nonpro\ufb01t partners, and much of it is \ndelivered by our \ufb02eet of 20+ trucks.\nFOOD IS PROVIDED TO OUR NEIGHBORS IN DIFFERENT WAYS\n4\n2\nFOOD ARRIVES AT CAFB DISTRIBUTION CENTERS:\nFood comes into one of multiple CAFB warehouses across the region. \nDonated food is sorted and packed up by some of the tens of thousands \nof volunteers who donate their time with us each year.\nGROCERY \nSTORE\nWhen people have the nutrition they need, along with support for other critical services, they also have greater \nopportunity to ful\ufb01ll their potential. Good food today enables brighter, healthier futures for our neighbors \u2013 \nand a more equitable region for all of us \u2013 tomorrow. Visit capitalareafoodbank.org for more information.\nNonpro\ufb01t \nPartner Network:\nCAFB provides food to a \nnetwork of 400+ nonpro\ufb01t \norganizations \u2013 including \npantries and soup kitchens \n\u2013 that in turn provide food \navailable to our neighbors. \nFor the majority of \norganizations in our \nnetwork, CAFB is the \nprimary source of food. \n\u201cFood Plus\u201d \nPartnerships:\nOur \u201cFood Plus\u201d \nprograms work to \naddress some of \nhunger\u2019s root causes \nby bundling access to \nnutritious food with \npartner-provided \nservices such as job \ntraining, health care, \nand education.\nDirect \nDistribution Sites:\nWe distribute food \ndirectly into communities \nwhere there are limited \nbrick-and-mortar \npartners available. \nThese distributions \ninclude free outdoor \nproduce markets and \nprograms in schools \nand senior centers. \nRETAIL \nGROCERY ACCESS\nThese mobile grocery \ntrucks operating in DC\u2019s \nWard 8 and Maryland\u2019s \nPrince George\u2019s County \noffer a new kind of \nneighborhood retail \noption, where people can \nbuy produce, protein, and \nother grocery staples at \naffordable prices..",

    "chunk_text": "Food insecurity in Maryland\nHunger affects individuals the world over, on every continent \nand in every country. The capital region of the United States is \nno exception. Nearly 1.5 million people in our area experienced \nsome level of food insecurity last year, meaning they weren\u2019t \nalways sure where their next meal would come from. \nIn CAFB\u2019s Maryland service region, which includes \nMontgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties, 41% of our \nneighbors are facing the difficult reality of food insecurity.\nHunger\u2019s impacts are far-reaching. Children have a more \ndifficult time learning. Adults struggle to concentrate. People \nof every age face higher rates of diet-related disease. Those \nimpacts ultimately affect the health of our communities,  \nand the vibrancy of our workforce and our local economies.  \nIn short, when people in our region don\u2019t have the food they \nneed, it impacts all of us.\nHow the Capital Area Food Bank makes a difference for our neighbors\nThe Capital Area Food Bank\u2019s mission is to help our neighbors \nthrive by creating equitable access to food and opportunity \nthrough community partnerships. Since 1980, we\u2019ve been \nthe backbone of the hunger relief infrastructure in the greater \nWashington region.\nEach year, we supply the food for nearly 60 million meals \nto a network of hundreds of nonprofit organizations across \nMaryland, Virginia, and DC. Those meals provide critical and \nimmediate assistance to those in need.\nBecause we know it will take more than food to solve hunger, \nwe also work to address several of hunger\u2019s root causes by \npairing food with services like health, education, and job \ntraining through partnership with other organizations.\n47% \nwas fruits  \nand vegetables \n31.6 million \nmeals worth of food distributed \nin MD last year.\n10% \nwas protein\nFOOD \nDISTRIBUTION \nLAST YEAR\nThe Facts About Hunger \nIN MARYLAND\nWe support a network of 172 nonprofit partners in Maryland \nacross Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties, including \nManna Food Center, Nourish Now, and SHABACH!
