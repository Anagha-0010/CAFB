Step inside, and you’ll find our Nutrition Education team in action. It’s recipe testing day, a hands-on process that ensures our recipe cards are as delicious and practical as they are nutritious.\nAt the heart of CAFB’s nutrition education efforts are ourrecipe cards,produce guides, and7 Ways cards, which offer new ways to use an ingredient. These resources help make cooking easy and accessible for the communities we serve. Before a recipe is added to our collection, it must pass a few tests. Does it taste good? Are the instructions clear? That’s where recipe testing and development days come in.\nOn this day, the team worked on a variety of dishes, from spicyshakshukato fillingbreakfast burritosand refreshingbeet salad. Recipes were made following preexisting recipes, or from scratch in a process to develop a new dish. Each dish had room for refinement where necessary, and the tweaks were carefully recorded.\n“Do you think this needs less onion?” “This needs more flavor.” Honest feedback flew around the kitchen as team members and other colleagues took turns tasting and evaluating. Adjustments were made on the spot, ensuring that every recipe meets our standards before making its way to the community.\nBeyond taste, our recipes are designed to be healthy and accessible. Every dish is run through software to analyze its nutritional profile and to align with the Healthy Pantry Initiative’s color-coded system. The goal is recipes that fall in the “green” and “yellow” categories, which means they are nutrient-rich and balanced. We prioritize ingredients commonly found in our food distributions, like beans, whole grains, and fresh produce, ensuring that the recipes we develop are truly usable.\n“A big thing we’re looking for with our recipes is that they are accessible meaning that they are easy for anyone to follow no matter the cooking level or the reading level. We test them to make sure that everything is clear and easy.” Keaton Bergeron, Nutrition Education Specialist\n\nWant to try these recipes for yourself?

{"title": "Inside CAFB’s advocacy work", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2025/02/27/inside-cafbs-advocacy-work/", "date": "February 27, 2025", "content": "Bycafb•February 27, 2025\n\nAs an organization working to get good food out today and build brighter futures for tomorrow, we know that advocacy is a key part of making that mission possible. From working with legislators to secure funding for essential anti-hunger initiatives to empowering clients to share their stories through our Client Leadership Council, our work advocates for effective policies at every level of government.\nWe sat down with Joe Liu, CAFB’s Director of Policy and Advocacy, to learn more about the team he leads and how they work throughout the year to influence policies that can reduce food insecurity.\nThe advocacy team at Capital Area Food Bank is comprised of a team of three that works closely together to analyze and advocate for policies across DC, Maryland and Virginia. We also recruit clients and support them in becoming advocates through ourClient Leadership Council, a 10-month long training program that empowers individuals to use their lived experiences to influence change and shape policy decisions.\nOur mission is the same as everyone else’s here at the food bank: to provide good food today and brighter futures for tomorrow. Our policy agendas focus on what we can do right now to help those facing food insecurity as well as other long-term policy changes we pursue over time. Some goals may take several years to achieve, but we work steadily toward them so we can make meaningful progress over time.\nIt means many miles in our cars driving to Annapolis, Richmond, and various county government offices. We track a lot of moving pieces and really rely on our coalition partners who also work on these issues. That way, we can share responsibilities and ensure that everything gets covered without having to be everywhere at once.\nWe work closely with groups like the Maryland Hunger Coalition, and with food equity councils and food policy councils in each jurisdiction. I also sit on the Maryland Food Resilience Council, which includes city and county officials, as well as legislators, all examining food policy issues. We’re part of a larger network of people who share common goals.\nOne of my favorite recent examples is when I went and testified for a bill about helping schools get easier access to local foods at school lunch and school breakfast. The other person testifying was from the Farm Bureau. We were able to bring watermen from the Eastern Shore who are catching and freezing invasive blue catfish out of the Chesapeake and distributing that fish straight to schools. Collaborations like that show how we can improve policy and make local, healthy foods more accessible to school kids.\nFirst, we want to secure more resources for the food bank and subsequently for our partners directly distributing food and putting it into the hands of our neighbors to meet the elevated levels of need we’re seeing. In Maryland, our top priority is to expand funding for food banks in the state, and that’s us covering Montgomery and Prince George’s counties and the Maryland Food Bank out of Baltimore that covers the rest of the state. We aim to ensure that public investments are multiplied by private philanthropy and donated food from the food industry, so everyone benefits on a much larger scale.\nAnother priority is expanding Food Is Medicine initiatives. Our healthcare pilot programs show that providing healthy food to people with chronic conditions not only improves health and food security but also reduces healthcare costs. We also continue to push for universal school meals and expanded SNAP eligibility.\nWe are constantly talking to legislators and other key stakeholders about potential bills. Sometimes we are used as a reference, “We heard from CAFB that this is a big issue.”\nWhen a bill is introduced, we analyze it, suggest amendments, and provide additional perspectives. We try and talk with everyone in our region as much as possible. During busy legislative sessions we focus on hearings for bills with traction while building long-term relationships with policymakers.\nThe Hunger Report is probably the tent pole for our advocacy work. It’s a hard edged, data driven presentation of what food security looks like in the Washington Metropolitan Area. Everybody from policy makers, foundations, members of state and local government look for and expect the yearly report. They rely on the data to make their own assessments of what and where needs are, and what they should do to address the need for food assistance. It provides us an opportunity to make the rounds and say: here is the latest data on food insecurity in our region.\nOur Client Leadership Council brings in the voice of people with lived experience who are actually affected by many of the policies and bills that are being considered. They can say, “this policy made a huge difference in my life,” whether by helping them finish college, get a better job, or feed a family. That is a powerful motivator, which resonates with legislators. I hear that from legislators, that they want to fight for a bill because the story of someone’s lived experience made an impact on them.  These connections ensure that our clients’ voices are heard and that they know they can influence policy.\nWe know that there are a lot of people who care about the food bank and care about the communities we serve. We want to expand our advocacy to other people who want to be involved and make their voices. Our hope is to take advantage of the knowledge and insights that our stakeholders already have and use them to strengthen the food bank’s impact to better serve our clients.\nClick hereto see our 2025 policy agendas and learn more about our current advocacy priorities.\n", "image_filenames": ["blo_004.png", "blo_005.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Joe-Headshot.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AdvocacyHeader.png"]}

We couldn’t have done it without our team of dedicated staff, our network of more than 400 partner organizations, our hardworking volunteers, and the generous contributions received from across our community.\nFrom expanding programs to launching new initiatives, we’ve taken big steps to meet the growing need for food access across the Greater Washington region. Here are 10 highlights that defined our year, what we did and why it matters:\nWe know that good food is essential to good health. That’s why we expanded the Healthy Pantry Initiative to all three regions we serve. This program provides a set of guidelines to help our pantry partners better serve their clients by offering culturally familiar foods and tailoring services to meet diverse needs. We also updated our existingrecipesand other nutritional resources to offer those tools in new languages for broader access and continued to develop new healthy recipes to support neighbors in preparing nutritious, affordable meals.\nWe’re now able to offer a new way to give back in Northern Virginia: volunteering at our expanded distribution center in Lorton. Whether you’re looking to give back as an individual or with a group, visitvolunteer.capitalareafoodbank.org\nWe worked to bridge the gap for children facing food insecurity by providing food when schools are closed, both during the summer time and year-round through our afterschool programs. We also made it more convenient for parents to access nutritious food, by hostingFamily Marketsat schools across the region. These programs ensure kids have the nutrition they need to learn, grow, and thrive.\nWe celebrated the graduation of the 4th class of the Client Leadership Council, now named in honor ofFather Eugene Brake, one of the food bank’s founders and a tireless advocate for change. We also welcomed the5th classof the CLC program, which kicked off in October. This 10-month program brings together individuals with lived experiences of food insecurity, empowering them to share their insights and guide our programs. Their perspectives are invaluable in shaping solutions that truly resonate with the communities we serve.\nThis year, we continued our commitment to partnerships withlocal farmsto bring fresh, seasonal produce to our community. With over 3.7 million pounds of local produce purchased this year, these partnerships not only supportlocal agriculturebut also help ensure that 40% of what we distribute is fresh fruits and vegetables.\nOur 5th annualHunger Reportis the only data-driven research study focused on food insecurity in the region. This year’sreportrevealed a significant increase in food insecurity, with 37% of households experiencing challenges at some point during the year. It also highlighted a concerning rise in middle-income families facing food insecurity, underscoring the broad and growing impact of economic instability. This data informs our work and drives targeted solutions to support those in need.\n\nWe introduced theSilver Marketand Senior Choice pilot programs to better meet the needs of older adults. These initiatives prioritize dignity and choice, providing seniors with fresh produce in a way that is accessible and works best for them.\nWe know that food can be medicine, and our food pharmacy program partners with healthcare centers to provides free, nutritious groceries to help patients manage chronic health conditions. In 2024, we expanded our program by opening three new locations atUnity Health Care, Children’s National Columbia Heights, and University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS). By meeting patients where they’re already receiving care, we’re tackling the link between food insecurity and health.\nOur newNorthern Virginia facilityin Lorton is up and running! This expanded space increases our capacity to distribute food to the region and makes it easier to serve our neighbors in NOVA.\nLast but certainly not least: All of these efforts culminated in being able to distribute 65 million meals across the greater Washington region. Through our 400 partner organizations and our direct distribution programs, we ensured that nutritious food reached those who needed it most.\nLooking Ahead:As we close out 2024, we’re grateful for everyone who has been a part of the journey to provide 65 million meals this year. As we enter 2025, we are committed to continuing to get good food to our clients today and helping build brighter futures for tomorrow.", "image_filenames": ["blo_028.png", "blo_029.png", "blo_030.png", "blo_031.png", "blo_032.png", "blo_033.png", "blo_034.png", "blo_035.png", "blo_036.png", "blo_037.png", "blo_038.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Masa-flour.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241029-CAFB-0367-1-3-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/LesTalusan_CAFB_240708_018.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CLC-5.0-Group-Shot-1-1024x767.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dodo-Farms-3.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1200x628_Blog-1024x536.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241120-CAFBSilver-0422-1-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20240930_CapitalAreaFoodBank_0079-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20240926-CAFBNoVa-1027-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-10-BedfordFalls-Partners-CAFB-KF-Storybox-116_websize-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241029-CAFB-0886-scaled.jpg"]}

Whether through her career in social services, her work as a member of our Client Leadership Council, or her family’s holiday traditions, Heather has always been a champion of empathy and kindness.\nEven as someone deeply familiar with helping others, Heather never expected to find herself in need of support. When life took an unexpected turn, she discovered how challenging it can be to navigate food insecurity and poverty, and how vital it is to have a voice in shaping solutions.\nWhen she was pregnant with her twin daughters, Olivia and Victoria, Heather faced significant health complications that left her unable to work. Shortly after, her husband Andre, a combat veteran, lost his small business. That was the instant when her family went from financial stability to facing food insecurity. Despite Heather and Andre’s education and years of work, “we went from not thinking about food, and being able to buy whatever food we needed, to becoming food insecure,” Heather explained.\nHeather quickly learned the sacrifices that come with living on a limited budget. “You get very protective of the food because you can’t just go out there and get exactly what you want,” she said. “Sometimes parents don’t eat, or they eat very little, so their kids can eat.”\n\nThose challenges grew when the pandemic-era expansion of SNAP benefits came to an end, resulting in her family losing nearly $600 a month in benefits. Soon after those cuts kicked in, Heather noticed her 13-year-old son trying to eat less to stretch the remaining food budget for the benefit of his parents and siblings. This caused headaches, mood swings, and difficulties concentrating in school. This heartbreaking reality illustrates how challenges in accessing enough to eat can ripple through families, causing immediate and long-term harm.\nHeather relied on her professional expertise to keep her family afloat. She became her own family’s case manager, connecting with Western Fairfax Christian Ministries, one of our partner agencies. There, she accessed supplemental groceries and holiday food baskets, allowing her family to have fresh produce and festive meals during difficult times.\nDespite the hardships her family has faced, Heather’s spirit of giving remains unwavering. She and her husband are teaching their four children to prioritize helping others. Together, they collect coats and food for neighbors in need, making giving a part of their year-round tradition.\n“My kids are always on the lookout for people they can help,” Heather said. “We try to make the holidays about others, not ourselves.”\n\nHeather’s story is a testament to the spirit of generosity that thrives even in the face of hardship. It’s also a reminder that food insecurity can touch anyone, and that access to support — whether through local pantries, government assistance programs, or other community-based assistance  — is essential for helping families navigate life’s challenges.", "image_filenames": ["blo_039.png", "blo_040.png", "blo_041.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20231213-FAHeather-2406-1024x569.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Heather-Holiday-1024x570.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20231212-FAHeather-0088-scaled-e1733782261852.jpg"]}
{"title": "How Family Markets bring healthy meals to families", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2024/12/03/how-family-markets-bring-healthy-meals-to-families/", "date": "December 3, 2024", "content": "Bycafb•December 3, 2024\nAt Barnard Elementary School in northwest Washington, D.C., families line up once a month in anticipation of the latest Family Market. A long line of tables stretches across the space, where volunteers work efficiently, packing bags of fresh food in an assembly-line style.\nThese monthly events are more than just food distributions: they’re a chance for the community to connect while taking home essentials for healthy meals.\n\nThese Family Markets are part of a program of 112 markets coperated by the food bank in partnership with schools like Barnard to get healthy food to kids and families who need it most. Hosting the markets directly at schools makes it easier for families to access fresh produce and other nutritious groceries at a place they already visit frequently.\nBarnard Elementary’s Family Market began last school year, initially serving around 90 families each month. Data from ourHunger Heat Mapshows that the school is located in an area with elevated levels of food insecurity, and school officials welcomed the monthly market as an additional resource for families who struggle to access enough food. Since the start, participation has steadily increased as more families and neighbors learn about the market. This November, roughly 170 families received food at the market, a testament to the need for accessible food.\nThe market serves as a convenient, welcoming resource for busy families. Shanita Adams, who picks up her fourth-grade niece after school, shared how the market helps introduce fresh vegetables into her meals. “It’s great for exposing her to more fresh produce and encouraging her to try new things,” she said.\nFor Jenel Buie, a mom of four, the Family Market is a way to instill healthy habits. “It’s nice to have the produce to get the kids in the habit of eating healthy,” she said.\n\nAt Barnard, the market thrives thanks to a collective effort. Barnard staffer Sandra Salamanca takes the lead in organizing, alongside a team of volunteers. Many volunteers are parents of current or former students, while others have previously benefited from the markets and now give back.\nOne parent volunteer shared how meaningful it is to give her time at the same school her children attend. “It shows [the children] an example of how they can grow up to give back and be champions for their community,” she said.\n\nFor many, the Family Market is a win-win: kids get to play and snack on fresh fruit while families take home the ingredients for healthy meals. These markets make a significant impact, ensuring everyone in the community has the support they need to thrive.\nPhotos by Maansi Srivastava", "image_filenames": ["blo_042.png", "blo_043.png", "blo_044.png", "blo_045.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241115_CAFB-FamilyMarket_0043-1-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241115_CAFB-FamilyMarket_0048-1-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241115_CAFB-FamilyMarket_0002-1-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241115_CAFB-FamilyMarket_0012-1-scaled.jpg"]}

It comes from government programs that source commodity foods from growers. It comes from schools and companies that holdfood drives.\nAnd it comes from wholesalers, which help us to provide the volume of food necessary to meet a level of need that still has not returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nOn any given day, our three warehouses in DC, Virginia and Maryland contain nearly 4 million pounds of food! Over the course of a year, they will fill and empty again more than a dozen times over.\n\nHow does the food get to our clients?\nWe’re proud to supply a network of 400 incredible nonprofit partners, who are helping people get the food they need to thrive today!\nThey include many organizations you might be familiar with, likeSOME(So Others Might Eat),DC Central Kitchen, andMartha’s Tablein Washington;Manna Food CenterandShabachin Maryland;Food for Others,ALIVE!, andHaymarket Regional Food Pantryin Virginia.\nBut what about in areas where the food bank doesn’t have a nonprofit partner?\nGreat question. We also distribute food directly into communities where there are limited brick-and-mortar partners available.\n\nWe deliver food directly to communities of seniors who need nutritious meals. We provide meals for kidsduring the summeras well as through afterschool programs during the school year, so children have the food they need to learn and grow.\nAnd each Saturday, we host farmer’s market-style distributions, called Community Marketplaces, where our neighbors can get fresh fruits and vegetables at no cost.\nAnd increasingly, we’re working with other organizations topair food with serviceslike job training, education, and health care that can help to address some of hunger’s root causes. These partners include community colleges and hospitals, like Children’s National Hospital, where we have collaborated on a food pharmacy.\nSo how many people do you reach through all of these programs?\nAll together, the food bank provided the food for 61 million meals last year, supporting the nearly 1.5 million people in our region who weren’t always sure where their next meal would come from.\nWow—that’s a lot of people.\nIt is, and because we help provide nutritious meals for so many people, we’re always focused on ensuring that the food we provide is nutritious and contributes to wellness.\n\nThat sounds like a big impact!\nIt sure is, andYOUmake it all possible.Every dollar can help to provide two mealsfor our neighbors facing hunger —click hereto make your contribution.\nThank you for supporting your neighbors!", "image_filenames": ["blo_046.png", "blo_047.png", "blo_048.png", "blo_049.png", "blo_050.png", "blo_051.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HowCAFBProvidesFood-1024x246.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Beauty-Blooms-Pictures-1-e1700236558863-1024x684.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/51722336821_92f890ca1b_k.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fooddelivery-1024x768-1.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/190111_Volunteers_GovtShutdown00012.jpg"]}
{"title": "An inside look at our warehouse during the holiday season", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2024/11/19/an-inside-look-at-our-warehouse-during-the-holiday-season/", "date": "November 19, 2024", "content": "Bycafb•November 19, 2024\nThe operations teams at our D.C. and Northern Virginia warehouses are the backbone of our work, ensuring that more than 60 million meals reach neighbors across the DMV each year. Every day, they orchestrate a well-choreographed dance of logistics, moving food in and out of warehouses to meet the region’s needs.\nThat choreography hits a crescendo in the months from October to December: our operations team is tasked with moving a far greater volume of food during the holiday season, when so many of our gatherings happen around food.\nTake a look at how the different roles within our operations team come together each morning to keep food moving in and out the door. But first, here are a few key pieces of warehouse lingo:\n\n\nBefore the sun rises, our warehouse is already alive with action. Forklifts zip around and the operations team greets the day with a mix of focus and camaraderie.\nOur team of drivers arrives at 5 a.m., to receive their assignments and start loading their trucks. With lists in hand, they move between the dry storage racks, cooler, and freezer, gathering the items needed to fulfill that day’s orders. Packing the trucks is like playing Tetris: the drivers must carefully arrange pallets to maximize space and ensure safe transport.\nDushane Clark, a driver who has been with the food bank for nearly 13 years, explains that while the usual schedule runs from 5a.m. to 2 p.m., during the busy season, it can stretch to 5 p.m. “One stop could mean unloading 20 to 30 pallets of food,” he says. Last month alone, the food bank’s drivers completed 929 deliveries, exceeding the 700 to 800 deliveries typical of average months.\nAs the trucks are loaded, they start pulling out of the warehouse by 7 a.m., each one bound for partner sites and direct distribution locations across the region.\nAs delivery trucks head out, the receiving team gets ready for the day’s incoming shipments. During an average month, the warehouse receives about five truckloads of food daily. In the busy season, that number can double, with over 4 million pounds of food arriving in a single month.\nThe receivers start by reviewing the day’s schedule and coordinating dock assignments for incoming trucks. When a truck arrives, they perform a quality check, ensuring the food was handled safely.\nAfter inspection, the team unloads the truck and counts and dates every single pallet before passing it along to the warehouse associates for storage in the freezer, cooler and racks for dry goods.\nOnce the food is unloaded, the warehouse and inventory associates step in. Their job is to scan each item into the system and distribute it to its proper location. This process ensures accurate inventory counts and smooth order fulfillment later.\nWith a growing focus on stocking culturally familiar foods like masa flour and a commitment to sourcing from local farmers, the inventory team is also handling a wider variety of options than ever before. Carl Robinson, a warehouse associate with 12 years of experience, shares that he’s seen a significant expansion in the variety of foods we offer, particularly fresh produce.\nThe pulling team arrives by 9 a.m. to pack orders for the following day. Looking at their assigned orders, they gather everything needed. Sometimes this consists of entire pallets, and other times it could be individual boxes.\nFor pullers like Carlton Colding, who has been with the team for over a decade, the work is labor-intensive but rewarding.\n“People are surprised I enjoy it, but I like knowing my job helps get food to people in need.”\n—Carlton Colding, Warehouse Associate\nIn an average month, the team fulfills 30 to 40 orders daily, but during the busy season, that number can climb up to 60. They stay until every order is complete, because without their work, the next day’s deliveries won’t happen.\nThroughout the warehouse, every team member has a critical role to play.\nThe opening of the expanded Northern Virginia facility in Lorton has also been a game-changer this season. Before that larger facility reopened, most food deliveries came to our DC headquarters, with food for Virginia-based distributions then delivered separately to our NOVA warehouse. With orders for the Northern Virginia region now fulfilled directly from Lorton, the DC team has fewer orders to handle, lightening their load during the busiest month.\nHunger exists year-round, and our operations team remains at the center of our mission to make sure families across the region have the nutritious food they need.", "image_filenames": ["blo_052.png", "blo_053.png", "blo_054.png", "blo_055.png", "blo_056.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/warehouse-unloading.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/back-of-truck-767x1024.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Henry-e1732040999208.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/forklift-reaching-high.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/warehouse.jpg"]}

But for some, meeting those needs is not always a reality. Shauna, a native Washingtonian, is no stranger to this struggle. Growing up in an area with a high cost of living, Shauna says “food insecurity has been a constant presence” in her life. And as a parent to three children with special needs, Shauna faces unique challenges that require her full attention as a caretaker, while her husband works full time to support their family.\n“One income, in this society right now, is really just holding on for dear life,” Shauna says.\nOur latestHunger Reportfound that food-insecure residents in the Greater Washington region are just as likely to be employed as those who are food secure. The misconception that hunger is a result of not working hard enough is not reality and Shauna’s story is a testament to this truth.\nShauna strives to provide nutritious meals that meet her children’s specific dietary needs, but balancing nutrition with affordability is a constant battle. Her and her husband sometimes make the difficult tradeoff to eat less so their children can have more. Shauna says groceries from the food bank and resources provided from other assistance programs make it possible to nourish her children in a way that might otherwise be out of reach.\n“If it wasn’t for the food banks, I know that my children may not have had the proper nutrition that they need,” Shauna says.\n\nShauna hopes to challenge the stigma that hunger only affects certain people, emphasizing that there are often invisible reasons why someone may face food insecurity. “Hunger is something that you don’t see. It’s not something that you see on a person and know they’re hungry,” she says. “A lot of times it takes a lot for a person to tell you that they’re hungry or that their family is hungry or that they’re suffering, just because of the stigma.”\nDespite these challenges, Shauna holds onto hope that her children will grow up in a more empathetic community, one that understands the nuances of hunger and where seeking help isn’t met with stigma. “Even when things get hard, we’re making sure our children have a better tomorrow.”\nShauna’s story was part of the food bank’s “Hunger is Here” public service announcement campaign.

The CLC program brings together individuals with lived experience of food insecurity equipping them with advocacy training so they can use their voices to advocate for policies that impact their communities.\nStarting with this year’s cohort, the program has been renamed in honor of one of the food bank’s founders: Father Eugene Brake. Father Brake dedicated his life to justice and social change through advocacy, action and service and it’s only fitting that our CLC is named after him.

They underscored the widespread nature of food insecurity among students, with NOVA President Anne Kress sharing that close to 50% of students there facing challenges in meeting their basic needs.\nAddressing food insecurity on our campuses is critical for increasing equitable outcomes in higher education.

That’s why we’re growing ourFood+Healthinitiatives, which bring food directly to patients where they receive care.\nIn partnership with Unity Health Care, we’ve launched a new food pharmacy at Unity’s East of the River Health Center in D.C.’s Ward 7. This food pharmacy is designed to provide patients—especially older adults managing conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and obesity—with nutritious, medically tailored groceries to support their health.\n\nPatients who screen for food insecurity at the clinic receive a “prescription” for the pharmacy, allowing them to pick up around 40 pounds of food twice a month — free of charge. They receive both shelf-stable foods and fresh produce, focusing on low sugar, high fiber, and nutrient-rich options. These groceries are specifically chosen to support the health of patients who have chronic conditions.\nData from ourHunger Reportshows that those facing food insecurity are twice as likely to experience diet-related illnesses that impact their daily lives, compared to those who are not food insecure. Combining food with medical care can be an especially powerful way to support ongoing wellness.\n\nThe new food pharmacy ismade possible with generous support from The J. Willard and Alice S. Marriott Foundation. It’s one of two locations planned in partnership with Unity Health Care, with a second site to launch within the next year at Unity’s Anacostia clinic. These food pharmacies are expected to reach 500 patients over the next five years.\n\nThrough initiatives like this, we are expanding the impact of Food as Medicine. We were honored to have Admiral Rachel Levine, MD, Assistant Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), join us during the food pharmacy’s grand opening to highlight the significance of these programs.\n\nPhoto credit: Maansi Srivastava", "image_filenames": ["blo_067.png", "blo_068.png", "blo_069.png", "blo_070.png", "blo_071.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240930_CapitalAreaFoodBank_0001-1-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240930_CapitalAreaFoodBank_0079-1-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240930_CapitalAreaFoodBank_0054-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240930_CapitalAreaFoodBank_0022-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240930_CapitalAreaFoodBank_0007-1-scaled.jpg"]}

This has been true for Daysi Oscategui, a single mother and first-generation college student. Daysi immigrated to the United States from Peru 23 years ago, settling in New York where she began her educational journey with accelerated English classes at a local community college. However, the demands of raising two young children forced her to put her education on hold.\nAfter moving to Northern Virginia to be closer to family, Daysi was determined to pursue her dream of higher education once again. In 2021, when her third child was just six months old, Daysi made a promise to herself: no matter what, she was going back to school.\nBalancing school while raising three children is a huge feat, and doing so in an area with a high cost of living has meant Daysi is constantly juggling to cover essential expenses.  Sometimes paying for food has come second to paying rent, which is non-negotiable.\n“You have so much against you like rent, bills, high food costs, and no help with childcare” – Daysi Oscategui\nOne factor Daysi credits for her success has been her enrollment in a pilot program created by the Capital Area Food Bank. With pilots on 5 campuses across the region, including Northern Virginia Community College, the food bank’s pilot program provides grocery store gift cards to eligible students. Daysi said she found out about the program when applying for other grant funding and immediately sought to enroll. Although she receives some support from federal food programs, it’s not enough to cover her full food budget. When she received her first grocery store gift card through the food bank’s program, she was relieved to know she would have enough money each month to meet her family’s needs.\n“The gift cards mean I know that I will have money to feed my family every month and won’t have to worry about splitting it for other expenses,” Daysi says.\nThe gift cards can be used at a conveniently located grocery store, and she uses them to buy fresh fruits, vegetables, and other nutritious foods for her children. This support makes it easier for Daysi to cover other necessary expenses, like paying for the internet access that allows her to attend online classes.\nDaysi is now in her final semester at Northern Virginia Community College, where her own son is also attending college. Soon, she expects to graduate with her associate’s degree in legal assistance/paralegal studies. Her next goal? Pursuing a bachelor’s degree in political science and a career as a paralegal, a field with greater job security and higher wages.\nAs we continue to expand our partnerships with colleges and universities, we’re committed to reaching more students like Daysi, providing them with the resources they need to thrive in school and beyond.\nDaysi shared her story at our third-annual Regional College Hunger Conference, where leaders from higher-education institutions gathered to collaborate on solutions to student food insecurity. Her journey serves as a testament to the impact that access to nutritious food can have on a student’s ability to succeed inside and outside the classroom.\n", "image_filenames": ["blo_072.png", "blo_073.png", "blo_074.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysi-Headshot.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241018_CapitalAreaFoodBank_0004-1-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241018_CapitalAreaFoodBank_0016-2-scaled.jpg"]}

This organization has become a lifeline for the growing Hispanic population in the area, offering not only food but also a sense of community and support.\nFounded in 2007 by Pastor Oliver Carter and his wife, Pamelia, No Limits Outreach started small, serving 20 to 30 people a week. As the need in the community grew, they partnered with the Capital Area Food Bank in 2017, expanding their operations to provide food for hundreds. After the pandemic, the organization moved to a permanent location in Landover, where they now distribute food several times a week. Every Friday, they serve around 500 people through a combination of appointments and walk-ups. This significant growth was fueled in part by advertising in neighborhood Facebook groups, specifically targeting the Latino population with posts in Spanish.\nTo improve their processes, a capacity grant from CAFB helped No Limits implement a texting system, allowing clients to join the line virtually and return when food is available. The grant also enabled them to offer additional services, including financial assistance and English classes, while securing a larger freezer to store more of the proteins that are in high demand, such as chicken.\nWith the community they serve being predominantly Hispanic, Pastor Oliver recognized a growing language barrier. Clients noticed it too and began stepping up to help. It started with a client named Jennifer, who became a regular volunteer. Now many of their 50 volunteers are former clients, including six who are Spanish speakers. Pastor Oliver shares, “Most who volunteer with us have come through the line themselves. They see the impact and want to give back.”\nThrough the hard work of these dedicated volunteers, who sort, organize, and distribute food daily,No Limits Outreachis working to ensure that no one in their community goes without. Their volunteers are proof of the lasting impact food assistance can have—by meeting an immediate need, but also empowering those who receive help to lend a hand in the future.

For our next feature, we head to Alexandria, VA, to highlight Mother of Light Center, a 100% volunteer-run organization dedicated to both meeting basic needs and uplifting education throughout their community.\nFounded in 2019, Mother of Light Center serves a predominantly Hispanic community, including many clients who have immigrated from Central and South America. Their mission is holistic, focusing on feeding, clothing, supporting, and nurturing those in need. In addition to food distribution, they offer a wide range of services, including support groups for single mothers and after-school programs for children.\nSince opening, Mother of Light has partnered with the Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) to operate a food pantry that serves more than 1,500 families every month. The pantry’s food comes both directly from the Capital Area Food Bank and through connections with grocery stores like Amazon Fresh, made possible by the food bank’s Partner Direct program. The food is distributed in two ways: through home deliveries and direct pick-up at the center. With 70% of the food delivered by van to local neighborhoods, the pantry ensures that food is as accessible as possible. They also prioritize their clients’ preferences by making sure to offer rice, beans, eggs, and fresh produce whenever possible.\nBeyond providing food, the food bank also has provided grants that have empowered Mother of Light to expand their services. One grant enabled the launch of an outreach program that increases awareness of their programs through text messaging software. Another supported the Read & Shine summer program, which began this summer in response to concerns among the community that children were behind on reading skills. Designed to improve literacy and foster a love of learning, the four-session program served 70 children and teens, with trips to the local library and reading activities that encourage children to explore books freely available to them.\nGrants from the food bank also supported the development of a Life Skills Training Manual, a comprehensive eight-session guide designed to equip participants with the tools they need to navigate daily challenges. The program is geared toward empowering single mothers in the community by preparing them for a “train-the-trainer” approach, where they can pass these valuable life skills on to other women in the community, fostering a network of support and leadership development.\n“We want clients to see our organization as a safe haven where they are treated with kindness and respect.” says Matilde Alvarado, founder of Mother of Light.Through their efforts, Mother of Light Center is not only addressing immediate needs but also empowering the next generation, exemplifying how good food today can lead to brighter futures tomorrow.", "image_filenames": ["blo_091.png", "blo_092.png", "blo_093.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mother-of-Light-Pantry-768x1024.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mother-of-Light-Child-Literacy-1024x768.jpeg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mother-of-light-bags-scaled-e1727117506345.jpeg"]}

One such partner is Latin American Youth Center (LAYC), a regional nonprofit serving youth and families in Washington DC, and Maryland’s Prince George’s and Montgomery counties. For more than 50 years, LAYC has been dedicated to supporting youth as they transition into successful adulthood, offering a wide range of programs that go beyond basic needs.\nFounded in the Columbia Heights neighborhood in response to a growing immigrant population, LAYC now serves a diverse community of young people, ages 6 to 24. Their services include mental health support, workforce programs, academic tutoring, housing and more. Each of these programs is designed to empower youth to overcome challenges and thrive. Although the center serves youth from all backgrounds, more than half of their participants identify as Latino.\nRecognizing the increased demand for food support during the pandemic, LAYC partnered with The Capital Area Food Bank to open a permanent food pantry in 2021. Today, the pantry provides food to any youth in need, with bags of groceries prepared at their DC building. Staff from various programs identify those in need and can access the pantry’s grab-and-go system at any time. During the holiday season, LAYC also runs larger food distributions, which have grown to serve more than 900 families during November and December.\nNot only has the food bank supported the pantry through sourcing food, it also has provided grants that enabled the purchase of a refrigerator that allowed for distributing more fresh fruits and vegetables.“Our partnership with Capital Area Food Bank is important to the work we do at LAYC which is providing support to the community,” says Flordelisa Perez Dolan, Chief Development and Communications Officer. “Access to nutritious food is the foundation for our youth and families to thrive. By addressing food insecurity, we’re also empowering young people to focus on their growth, eating nutritious food, and learning life skills such as cooking.”\nTo ensure their services reflect the needs of the community, the pantry stocks culturally appropriate foods, such as masa harina, a corn flour used in many Latin American dishes, based on client requests. In addition to their year-round efforts, LAYC celebrates Hispanic Heritage Month with activities like a potluck and a parade of flags, fostering a deeper connection between youth and their heritage.\nBeyond food distribution, the center’s Food and Nutrition Program also engages youth through hands-on cooking, nutrition, and gardening classes. Youth in the after-school arts and leadership program participate in 10-week cooking courses that combine nutrition education— such as the importance of fruits and vegetables—with cooking skills. Meanwhile, classes for younger children (6-12) at the Rita Bright Family and Youth Center encourage them to try new ingredients and explore foods through their senses.  The program also offers drop-in cooking classes to youth with unstable housing, teaching them how to make meals with limited resources. Through these programs, children and teens are also introduced to broader food-justice issues, encouraging them to work toward positive change through community advocacy.\nLAYC caters to immediate needs and empowers youth with the tools and skills they need to succeed — a great example of how good food today can support brighter futures tomorrow.", "image_filenames": ["blo_094.png", "blo_095.png", "blo_096.png", "blo_097.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/LAYC-Pantry-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/LAYC-cooking-demo-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/LAYC-volunteers-1024x768.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/LAYC-cooking-class.jpg"]}

That’san increase of 5 percentage pointsfrom last year’s report, when 32% of households in the region experienced food insecurity during the prior year.\nIt’s also the highest level of regional food insecurityseen since CAFB began working with the highly trusted independent social research organization NORC at the University of Chicago in 2022 to gather data for the report via a general population survey. Looking across the region, that level of prevalence meansnearly 1.5 million people struggled to access enough food.\n\nThe only study of its kind,Hunger Report 2024makes profoundly clear that beyond the many positive economic headlines of the last year, there are enormous numbers of our neighbors experiencing a different reality. The report illuminates the multiple, often compounding forces that continue to make putting food on the table extremely difficult for neighbors across the region.\nHigher rates of food insecurity were reported acrossvirtually everycategory of geography,incomeand race,when compared to the prior year. People of color, families with children, and those with lower incomes and levels of educational attainment continue to be experiencing food insecurity at disproportionate rates. However, this year’s data also depicteda food-insecure population that is growing increasingly educated and more middle-class,with large spikes seen in food insecurity among middle-income households.\nThe report’s findings are the result of a general population survey of 3,800 residents, conducted in partnership with the highly trusted independent social research organization NORC at the University of Chicago. It provides a detailed look at who is experiencing food insecurity in the Greater Washington region, the tradeoffs that too many of our neighbors are forced to make between food and other necessities like housing and healthcare, and recommendations that ever sector can take to address these challenges in both the short and longer term.\nRead Hunger Report 2024\nMany people might be surprised to see higher rates of food insecurity across our region after a year of relatively positive economic news. Butin every county, more householdsexperienced hunger over that 12-month period. Those county-level rates ranged from 23% in Arlington, Va., to50% in Prince George’s County.\n\nWhat does food insecurity look like across the region? Here’s a snapshot:\n\nThe rate of food insecurity among children tends to be lower than the general household rate, due to adults skipping meals or taking other steps to prioritize food for their children. But the prevalence of food insecurity among children remains significant: 10% of children are food insecure, equating to 103,000 children across the region.\nMost food-insecure respondents reported that their household’s financial situation has gotten worse since last year, making it more difficult to afford essentials like food.\nA combination of forces is driving those financial challenges, includinginflation, ongoing employment hardships, and the reduced levels of government benefits.\nAs the cost of living has continued to climb during the last four years,wages havelagged behindand government benefits were temporarily boosted but later reverted to lower levels of support.Employment hardships have lingered or increased across sectors, with loss of hours, wage cuts, and layoffs still relatively common. And after March 2023, when emergency allotments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ended, many households were left fully exposed to the effects of inflation with less income – both earned and supplemental.\n\nAmong people who said their household finances had worsened over the last year, 20% of people overall, and 32% of people with children, cited a loss or reduction of federal benefits as a major reason.\nWhen it comes to inflation’s effects,66% of residents reported that higher costs for food have had a major impact on their finances, up from 52% last year. Among food-insecure individuals, 88% of people cited higher food prices as having a major financial impact.\nHigher costs beyond food also have strained budgets, making it more difficult to afford enough nutritious food.Nearly half of respondents – 46% – said higher housing costs had a major impact on their household budget.Those higher costs were felt most acutely among those struggling with food insecurity: 69% of those experiencing food insecurity cited housing costs as having a major impact on their budget, compared to 32% of the food-secure population.\nFood is frequently one of the first areas where people trim back in order to make ends meet. In this year’s survey,46% of the region’s residents reported running short of money and trying to make their food budget stretch, describing a range of coping strategies for trying to bridge this gap in their budget:\n\nThe report also found that the average food-insecure household with children is spending far less in a typical month on food than what experts say is needed to purchase enough food for their household.\nFactoring the costs of covering a family’s basic needs where they live, experts from the Economic Policy Institute, MIT, and United Way have each calculated the minimum income that families of various sizes need to make ends meet in different geographies. They suggest that a typical family of four would need a minimum monthly food budget of $1,271, but food-insecure respondents were spending less than half of that amount — only $649 per month – on food between their government benefits ($218) and their own earned income ($431).\nWhile charitable food providers are stepping in to fill in a portion of that gap, 54% of those who are food-insecure said they did not access assistance from the charitable food network. That gap can lead to poorer health and nutrition for thousands of families.\n\nAddressing food insecurity and its key drivers will require a range of strategies across the public, private and non-profit sector, including:", "image_filenames": ["blo_098.png", "blo_099.png", "blo_100.png", "blo_101.png", "blo_102.png", "blo_103.png", "blo_104.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CAFB_HungerReport2024_Charts-Graphs_v4_Change-in-food-security-in-the-DMV-scaled-e1726101579981-1024x861.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CAFB_HungerReport2024_Charts-Graphs_v4_Prevalence-of-food-insecurity-in-the-DMV-scaled-e1726101709800-1024x742.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CAFB_HungerReport2024_Infographics_v4c_1-1-903x1024.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CAFB_HungerReport2024_Infographics_v4c_3-1024x483.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CAFB_HungerReport2024_Infographics_v4c_5-1-1024x907.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CAFB_HungerReport2024_Infographics_v4c_8.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1200x628_Blog_v2.png"]}

The DC resident says, without direct access to a garden, she struggles to get the fruits and vegetables she loves. When she goes to the grocery store, Rosalind is shocked to see how much the price of produce has increased. And the higher prices don’t always mean higher quality: at her nearest store, she often finds that the cucumbers are soft, and the tomatoes lack taste.\nWe met Rosalind at the our newly launched Silver Market, which offers seniors a new option for accessing high-quality fresh fruits and vegetables. Income-eligible seniors ages 55 and up can schedule an appointment to come and “shop” at the market, which is set up like a farmers market. With an emphasis on fresh produce and frozen protein items, seniors are able to access the nutritious foods that they want and need for a balanced diet.\n“With the heightened prices, you go to the grocery store and buy five items that aren’t even enough to make a full meal.”\nRosalind Fowler-Dunmore\nFrom corn on the cob to blackberries, the produce selection is seasonal and often comes from local farmers. Rosalind looks forward to receiving her items as it means she can make the recipes she grew up eating for herself and her husband.\n“This is a lifesaver,” Rosalind says.\nThe Silver Market also serves as a place for clients to obtain other services, in addition to a selection of fresh produce.

With grit and determination, Father Brake and others, including CAFB’s first CEO Lynn Brantley, set to work gathering food from local grocers and growers, and distributing it to those in need. Together they laid the groundwork for CAFB to open its doors – with great intention – on Martin Luther King, Jr.’s birthday in January of 1980.\nFather Brake was a tireless champion for the needs of people in low-income communities. Growing up in poverty in Delaware, he later devoted his life to the service of those experiencing hunger and homelessness in the Washington region, working and often living in the places of greatest need.\nHe was a man of great faith, and also a man of great action. Everyone in the CAFB community who knew him describes him as a person constantly on the go (Father Brake himself was fond of calling himself “Fast Brake”). In the early years of the CAFB’s founding, that meant driving around to collect food in an old pickup truck and taking it to people who needed it, sometimes fielding calls late at night from those seeking help.\nLater on, when the food bank had its own fleet of trucks and drivers, that meant doing whatever was needed, from painting something in the warehouse to building new desks for a reconfigured office when space was getting tight. All of this was performed with an air of cheerful urgency, a sense that whatever he was doing in that moment to support the organization’s mission could not wait.\nFather Brake once said “All I ever wanted was the same opportunities for everybody. That’s what drives me. It’s the very nature of Christianity.”By all accounts, that sentiment shaped every aspect of how he approached his life of service.\nI am incredibly proud that the passion for equity that drove Father Brake to help lead the food bank’s founding is still woven into the fabric of the organization today. His “can do” spirit, his deep commitment to the community, his fierce belief that all people deserve the same chance at a good life, and his understanding that food underpins opportunity and is one of our most essential human rights all live on thanks to his unyielding efforts.\nHe made a profound difference for millions of people during his life, and through his legacy, he will continue to do the same.", "image_filenames": ["blo_110.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/father-eugene-brake.png"]}

Their facial reactions spoke for themselves as they gazed up at the tall racks for storing food and ventured into the larger cooler and freezer.\nAkmal Hassain, Outreach and Hunger Prevention Coordinator at ICNA, says he is inspired by the new building’s added capacity and efficiency, and how it will help their organization in serving a number of clients that continues to rise each month. The new facility is four times the size of the previous space, allowing for more storage and increased food variety.\n“Ultimately our clients will be having more options and more food.”\n– Akmal Hassain, Outreach and Hunger Prevention Coordinator, ICNA\n\nIn the past year, both organizations have seen growth in the number of neighbors they serve monthly. Shirley Couteau, Program Manager at ACTS, noted that the organization is now serving around 1,000 families a month.\nNot only is there more space to store shelf-stable items to meet the need that is still rising, but the larger cooler and freezer also mean that more produce and frozen proteins will be available.\n“I’m already picturing what foods I can order now.”\n– Shirley Couteau, Program Manger, ACTS\nIn addition to the added capacity to provide more food, partners will also be able to use the expanded office space in the new building.

They have the opportunity to learn from both professionals and their peers. For instance, a recent session included presentations by Dr. Jessica Young of American University and Dr. Janice Davis of Howard University on overcoming personal and social stigma, as well as the impact of inequities embedded in American systems.\n\nGet to know several members of the current class and what they’ve learned from this year’s program:\n\nAge:45\nHometown:Chevy Chase, MD\nBackground:Demeke started his career by working at the Ethiopian Community Center, where he eventually progressed to a leadership role. He has consistently sought opportunities to enhance his understanding of client dynamics and improve the client experience. He says that the CLC’s focus on collaborative learning, and staying ahead of industry trends aligns with both his professional goals and personal values. After graduating from the CLC, he plans to continue advocacy work and connect with stakeholders to address the issue of hunger in the community.\n“The CLC equipped me with the tools to articulate the needs of my community, particularly in areas such as food security, housing, and access to essential benefits. By learning how to frame these issues compellingly, I have been able to advocate more effectively for comprehensive solutions that address the root causes of poverty and hunger.”\n-Demeke Shiferaw\n\nAge:49\nHometown:Washington, DC\nBackground:Corena is a single mother of seven adult children and is raising her youngest granddaughter. She has struggled to get a job at times and relies on programs such as SNAP and WIC to make ends meet. Even with assistance, she finds that it is often just enough to survive. Through the Client Leadership Council, she has gained tools to advocate for herself and others in a positive and constructive way. After graduation, she hopes to fight for more change and make a difference.\n“I’ve learned that all races and religions are the same when it comes down to food inadequacies.”\n-Corena Watkins\n\nAge:27\nHometown:Washington, DC\nBackground:Tahjae faced numerous challenges growing up in Congress Park and becoming a young mother at 15. She looks to her strong single mother who worked multiple jobs to make ends meet as inspiration to break the norm and become a positive influence in her Southeast DC community. Throughout the program, she has learned that it is OK to start over in life. After graduation, she hopes to start her own non-profit organization for youth.\n“Joining the CLC is my way of contributing to positive change and starting as a catalyst for progress.”\n-Tahjae Pitts\n\nAge:31\nHometown:Washington, DC\nBackground:Joshua is a native of Prince George’s County. He is a Navy veteran and identifies as part of the LGBTQ+ community. After the pandemic, he lost his job and decided to go back to school at Howard University. This exposed him to how widespread food insecurity is and how much it hinders students. He says the CLC has provided him with tools to advocate on behalf of others in similar situations to him. His key takeaway for the future is to take every opportunity to speak up because you never know who is listening and will hear what you have to say.\n“I now know that the only way we can make the normative changes we want to see for underserved communities is by showing humility and being honest with each other in what we experience.”\n-Joshua Burris\n\nAge:38\nHometown:Annandale, VA\nBackground:Mariam was born and raised in Pakistan. In 2007, she immigrated to the U.S. with her father. Overcoming challenges such as language barriers, housing difficulties, and food insecurity, she learned how to be self-reliant and grew empathy for others facing similar difficulties. The CLC has exposed her to the multifaceted nature of food insecurity and how various organizations work together to support vulnerable populations.

That’s unacceptable, and alongside nearly 100 leaders of key organizations involved in addressing food access for DC seniors, we met to talk about how to better collaborate to address this issue.\n\nSeniors often have limited income, making it difficult to afford food and other expenses like rent and medicine.  They may not have access to transportation to grocery stores where they can access nutritious food, and they are more likely to have chronic health conditions that make cooking and grocery shopping difficult.But through collaboration, we can better ensure that those who have given so much can access the food they need.\nDuring the daylong event, leaders of the food bank, DC’s Department of Aging and Community Living, and The Washington Home spoke about the high food insecurity rate of seniors in the District – and our shared commitment to reducing it. Members of the food bank’s Client Leadership Council detailed their experiences as seniors facing hunger. During breakout sessions, we laid the foundation for working together more effectively and efficiently to reach our vulnerable neighbors.\n\nThese insights, stories and brainstorming sessions were paired with a deep-dive into the data available on where programs seeking to serve seniors are — and are not yet — meeting the need we know exists. The food bank’s analytics team shared ourSenior Hunger Heat Map, a new tool showing how areas of need overlap with areas where meals are available. The map was built using data detailing food distributions through our senior programs and through food bank partners, as well as data contributed beforehand by conference attendees.\nAmong the takeaways from the Senior Hunger Heat Map:\n\nMore data collaboration will enable this map to become an even more powerful tool for identifying areas of our community that require more food assistance. By better understanding where seniors live and where they currently access services, we can assess whether older residents are being served through existing programs for senior or for the broader population — or if they may require more targeted outreach to help overcome certain obstacles, such as limited transportation.\nA special thank-you toThe Washington Home, which not only sponsored our electric van for delivering food to seniors, but also provided generous support to make the conference possible.\n\nPhoto credit: Imagine Photography", "image_filenames": ["blo_120.png", "blo_121.png", "blo_122.png", "blo_123.png", "blo_124.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CAF240516-7892.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CAF240516-7978.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CAF240516-8111-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CAF240516-.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Senior-conference-van-featured-image.jpg"]}

It means storage racks that previously stretched just two pallets high now are much taller, with the capacity to store five pallets of food.\nAnd it means much more space in the cooler and the freezer, which will allow for distributing far more fresh produce and frozen protein to our neighbors.\nThese features will not only allow the food bank to better serve our neighbors in Northern Virginia, they will also make distributing food across the region more efficient. With more truck bays, the facility in Lorton will be able to receive more food directly instead of receiving food that’s initially delivered to our main warehouse in Northeast DC. That will also increase capacity at our DC warehouse to get food out to partners in the District and in Maryland.\nThe expanded cooler will now hold up to 468 pallets of food — nearly 10 times what could be stored in the old cooler. That will allow the food bank to source and distribute increased quantities of nutritious produce and protein. It will also enable CAFB to purchase more fresh food from our region’s local farmers, enabling our clients to access more items that were grown right here in the Greater Washington region.\nOverall, this expanded space will enable the food bank to be more efficient and effective in how we’re getting food to those who need it.

Instantly, Iman describes one of her favorite ways to transform the often-overlooked vegetable into a tasty, nutritious dish.\nThe celery is tucked into one of three black reusable bags brimming with groceries that Iman takes home with her, thanks to a partnership between the Capital Area Food Bank and Children’s National that offers a food pharmacy to the clinic’s patients who are struggling to access enough nutritious food.\n\nThose bags of groceries have had a major impact on Iman’s diet, empowering her to feel more in control of managing her health condition. Not only has she seen more consistency in her blood sugar levels since she started receiving groceries from the food pharmacy in September, but she also has lost weight, has more energy, and has a greater ability to focus on her cybersecurity classwork at the University of the District of Columbia.\n“It took a lot of weight off my shoulders,” she says.\nBefore she learned about the food pharmacy at Children’s National, Iman had struggled to access enough nutritious food. The DC native grew up in an area of the city with few grocery stores, and when she moved on campus, she found more food options near her, but with prices that often exceed her budget.\n\n“Being in an area where food is really expensive, and then the food that I need is extra expensive, it has made me feel a little bit scared at times,” says Iman, adding that during her early weeks of classes, she felt exhausted as she tried to stretch her meals.\nNow she visits the food pharmacy every two to three weeks, where she receives 30 to 40 pounds of fresh produce and shelf-stable groceries. During each visit, she receives a mix of proteins, whole grains, and cooking essentials like garlic and ginger.The offerings also includeitems like almond milk, which are helpful for Iman,who follows a vegan diet.\n“They give you a lot of food, even fresh produce, which I love because that’s one of the hardest things for me to really get my hands on,” Iman said.\n\nSincelaunching two years ago, the food pharmacy at Children’s National has become a popular option for patients like Iman. Dietitians at the clinic say families increasingly have chosen to schedule their appointment at the main hospital rather than at satellite locations so they can access the groceries provided there.So far, nearly 3,200 patients have received groceries through the food pharmacy.And anew study that launched earlier this year will gather data on how consistent access to nutritious food affects health outcomes for patients with prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes.\nIman says she’s seen changes in her overall well-being since she started visiting the food pharmacy, including losing 30 pounds. An avid weightlifter, she also has noticed that she has more energy to go to the gym and to move her body.\nShe’s also noticed a difference when it comes to managing her prediabetes. Her blood sugar levels are more consistent day to day, and when she does need to stabilize those levels, she knows that she has foods in her pantry that can help her do so.“I feel like I can manage my diabetes, that this is something that I can like really do myself,” Iman says.\n\nPhoto credit:Rebecca Drobis", "image_filenames": ["blo_134.png", "blo_135.png", "blo_136.png", "blo_137.png", "blo_138.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024.02.02-CAFBCNMC_37_CC-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024.02.02-CAFBCNMC_111_CC-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024.02.02-CAFBCNMC_103_CC-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024.02.02-CAFBCNMC_88_CC-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024.02.02-CAFBCNMC_111_CC.jpg"]}

That work has left a lasting legacy that now, thanks to a significant new gift from her husband William “Bill” Conway, Jr., will only grow larger.\n\nWilliam “Bill” Conway, Jr. has committed $10 million to the food bank to address regional food insecurity through one of his philanthropic vehicles, the Bedford Falls Foundation DAF. The gift is a multi-year investment that honors his late wife’s dedication to helping kids, families, and other individuals through her philanthropic leadership.\nThe new funding will support a range of programs across the food bank, including the purchase of fresh produce; work that supplies critical nutrition to children; and initiatives that provide nutritious groceries to college students facing hunger.\n“Joanne was passionate about helping those in need improve their lives,” Conway said. “I can think of no better way to honor her memory and to carry on her legacy of compassion than by supporting the Capital Area Food Bank in helping those facing food insecurity.”\nThe largest gift from a donor in the Capital Area Food Bank’s history, it is the latest among a series of investments made by the Conways to the food bank during the last decade, which total $23 million.\nTheir support of those facing food insecurity has includeda $5 million foundation grant in 2010that enabled the food bank to begin construction of a new 123,000-square-foot facility that bears the name of their Bedford Falls Foundation. The facility in Northeast Washington is CAFB’s main warehouse in the region, and its construction allowed the food bank to double its capacity at a time when need was rising in the region.\n\nIn 2011,the couple’s support of CAFB’s Fresh Produce Campaignhelped enable the food bank to continue offering fresh fruits and vegetables to its nonprofit partners at no cost, ensuring those foods would remain readily available for people in need. Produce, which made up nearly half of the food CAFB provided last year, is an important part of a healthy diet but can be cost prohibitive for those with limited budgets.\nThe new investment will provide significant support for the purchase and distribution of nutritious foods, including enabling the food bank to continue its emphasis on offering fresh fruit and vegetables.\nFunds will also be directed towards the food bank’s “Food Plus Education” initiatives, which supply groceries and meals to college students who may be struggling to put food on the table. In keeping with Joanne’s passion for empowering individuals with the skills and opportunities needed to find fulfilling employment, the gift will focus in particular on assisting students in fields where demand for jobs is high, such as nursing programs and information technology.\nAdditionally, the gift will be used to support the food bank’s programs focused on meeting the dietary needs of children.\n“This is an absolutely transformational level of generosity,” said Radha Muthiah, president and CEO of the Capital Area Food Bank. “This gift will enable greater health and greater opportunity for thousands of our neighbors, and is such a fitting tribute to Joanne’s remarkable vision and legacy.

If you give them things that are soggy or bad.”\n“So imagine us being able to restore dignity” by offering fresh, high-quality produce, she says. “It makes me very happy.”\nThe food bank began working with Tope and Dodo Farms last year as we expanded our network of local farm partners. During 2023, we purchased enough vegetables from the Montgomery County-based farm to provide more than 6,100 meals.\n\nThe potatoes, kale, collards, and other items that Dodo Farms delivered to food bank partners and clients during the growing season were typically harvested from the dirt no more than a day before they were delivered – and for an afternoon delivery, the broccoli greens or cabbage might be plucked from the ground that same morning.\nThe freshness of their produce isn’t just about logistics – Tope says it’s another way to show respect to clients receiving the food.\n“We get that feedback a lot that people appreciate that they get fresh foods,” Tope says.\nTope and her husband immigrated from Nigeria, where Niyi also worked as a farmer. They’ve enjoyed introducing Americans to foods they might not be familiar with, like different varieties of kale or other greens that are more common in West Africa.\n\nBut they’ve also been excited when they’ve encountered familiarity. Some of the areas they are serving with their produce include African immigrants like themselves.\n“We’re very excited to serve that population. It just feels good,” Tope says, recalling how husband returned from a delivery and told her: “I can hear people speaking our language.”\n“We want to build community around food, around good food,” she adds.\n\nFor six seasons, the couple has been farming on leased land in Montgomery County. They’ve purchased 10 acres of land in Howard County, which Tope says will allow them to expand, both when it comes to the crops they’re growing and the ways they interact with their customers. That includes hosting clients at the farm so they can see howthefoodthereis grown.\n“They can feel connected to the land,” she says, adding: “But we can only do this with partners like Capital Area Food Bank.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_143.png", "blo_144.png", "blo_145.png", "blo_146.png", "blo_147.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2022.05.31_DodoFarms_167_CC-e1709674416281.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dodo-Farms-1.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dodo-Farms-3.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2022.05.31_DodoFarms_016_CC-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dodo-Farms-Featured.jpg"]}

But Michelle Engelmann from Temple Sinai Women of Reform Judaism was confident that they’d achieve their goal.\nSince before the COVID-19 pandemic, Temple Sinai has come together to support the Capital Area Food Bank and communities in need.During the fall, Michelle organizes their annual fall High Holidays fund drive, which raised more than $35,200 in 2023.\nThe funds raised in connection with the High Holidays — Yom Kippur, which is the Day of Atonement, and Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year — provided more than 70,400 meals for our neighbors facing hunger.  We spoke with Michelle to learn more about what motivates their community to hold this annual fundraiser, and how they grow their success year after year.\n\nCapital Area Food Bank:Temple Sinai Women of Reform Judaism has fundraised online for the High Holidays for the past four years. What inspired you to start the online fundraiser in 2020?\nMichelle:We used to have a food drive on Yom Kippur morning, and after the morning services, the Capital Area Food Bank would pick up all of the cans and boxes. That gradually got bigger but became so huge and difficult to coordinate. As I learned more about CAFB and the best way to serve the people experiencing hunger, I learned how much better it would be if we donated money so CAFB could purchase the food at a much better rate.\nSo I started doing a combined food and fund drive before the COVID-19 pandemic, and then during the pandemic, with services and everything on Zoom, it was really easy to make the transition to an online fund drive. I think it worked out really well and it’s taken off now.\nCAFB:Yom Kippur is the Day of Atonement in the Jewish faith, with many choosing to fast for the day. Why do you choose this time of year at the High Holidays to gather donations?\nMichelle:Temple Sinai is focused on food and fasting in a way that a lot of synagogues are. In publicizing the campaign, we’ve suggested to those that are fasting that they can donate the money they would’ve spent on food for that day. But I also like to talk about it in terms of helping the community. While we’re focused on whether or not we can eat in a painless fasting, what is it like if somebody is fasting and it’s not their choice?\nCAFB:This year, close to 120 donors participated in the campaign. What do you do to prepare for such a large-scale fundraiser?\nMichelle:Since Yom Kippur is in September, I usually start in late summer about a month or two before the campaign begins. We set up the online fundraising page in advance, collect facts and statistics about hunger in the region, and prepare our publicity and outreach.\n\nCAFB:How do you share this fundraising opportunity with members of the temple? How do you spread the word?\nMichelle:A month before the fundraiser begins, I start including it in our four newsletters. I put out really dynamic facts about hunger and the need in our community, which I try to change during the course of the fundraiser. “Over a million people in the DMV region not knowing where their next meals is coming from,” was a big one. Including the fact that $20 can feed a family of four for four to five days also helped people to know how much good they’re doing by making donations. I also publicize that they can donate however they want—online through a credit card, they can send a check, or use their donor-advised funds.\nCAFB:Are you planning on hosting the High Holidays fundraiser again? If so, what are your goals for 2024\nMichelle:I’m planning to have the fundraiser again! Even if I weren’t able to, someone from the Temple Sinai Women of Reform Judaism would continue it.\nOur goals, as always, are to surpass whatever we achieved in the past years. This year was the first year we offered donations through donor-advised funds, so we want to have that option as well as the online fundraise and ability for people to write and mail checks. We also want to come for a tour and volunteer in the warehouse!", "image_filenames": ["blo_148.png", "blo_149.png", "blo_150.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0765-e1705509224224-1024x738.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fundraiser-screenshot-1024x577.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_8432-1-1-scaled.jpg"]}

We’re dedicated to addressing the barriers to food assistance, so we can reach as many of those in our community who need help accessing enough nutritious food.\nBut how do we go about doing that? That’s where one of our most powerful data tools comes in: theHunger Heat Map.\n\nThe map helps us to visualize the landscape of hunger in our region, seeing where the highest levels of food insecurity are and where we need to create new food distributions, find new partners, or innovate our approaches. This is a tool we’ve been using for years, but recent updates now allow us to work with renewed accuracy and precision.\nThe biggest question the map helps us to ask is this:are there locations where people aren’t getting help as much as other locations? One layer lets us look at two things at the same time – the level of food insecurity in a given area and how much food people are accessing in that area.\n\nThe black squares represent areas that have high levels of food insecurity but low levels of food distribution. That means that there are people there who need food but aren’t getting it – at least not from us or our partners. This helps us know if we need to add new direct distribution sites there, or if there are other organizations we should be partnering with in that area.\nThe heat map also helps us to look at how well we’re serving different ethnic identities. If there are inequities in how we’re reaching different ethnic populations, there may be adjustments needed to our distribution strategies.\n\nThe next step for us is to look more closely at the types of food getting distributed in areas with those kinds of discrepancies: what percentage of it is culturally appropriate? What cultures are accessing foods targeted to their needs – and what cultures might we be missing?\nAnother possibility is that people aren’t accessing the food because the staffing and other resources at food distributions might not be in a familiar language, and they either don’t know the sites exist or don’t feel comfortable engaging with them. Identifying these types of locations allows us to recruit new partners or develop new capacity among our existing partners to reach out in more languages.\nThe Hunger Heat Map has been a wildly helpful tool in guiding our work so far. Given its new capacity for accuracy and precision, we’re so excited for how it can even better enable us to serve our community.\nThis is just a handful of information you can find on the Hunger Heat Map.

That’s why we’ve created theClient Leadership Council (CLC): to empower food-insecure individuals to have a voice in the policy decisions that impact their lives. Through this 10-month advocacy training program, our clients learn how to harness the power of their lived experiences to shape public policy and food bank programming by sharing their stories with media, politicians, and beyond.\nGet to know several members of our fourth Client Leadership Council class and why they’re participating in this year’s program:\n\nAge:49\nHometown:Silver Spring, MD\nBackground:Eneshal grew up in Washington, D.C. She is one of seven children, and remembers all too well how hard is was for her mother to keep food on the table and stay housed. She’s had many jobs, including working as a social worker and serving on the Interagency Commission on Homelessness in Montgomery County, Md.\nEneshal is passionate about farming and developing community gardens.  She runs an urban farm through the University of the District of Columbia, providing food and information to residents of the community even as she still faces food insecurity herself. One day, she hopes to run for office to continue making a difference.\n“It broke my mothers heart when she lost our home, but she never gave up on us. There are children and seniors, who go to sleep at night with nothing to eat. I want to end hunger, inequality, poverty, and teach people how to grow food.”\n-Eneshal Miller\n\n\nAge:34\nHometown:Prince George’s County, MD.\nBackground:Jonathan has always been looking to help, even while he was experiencing homelessness. He’s worked for the DC Department of Behavioral Health, he’s volunteered with food distributions across the region, and he’s passionate about housing and supporting the mental health of his community. He’s diabetic, which makes food especially challenging, and food assistance especially important.\n\n\n“I joined because I wanted to meet and build a community of people who believe in helping.”\n-Jonathan Gibbs\n\n\nAge:44\nHometown:Washington, D.C.\nBackground:Tamika was born with cerebral palsy, affecting her arms and legs. That hasn’t stopped her from working to improve her community, though: she volunteers with Salvation Army regularly. She recently got married, which cut her disability benefits, and she’s not receiving enough support to get by. But Tamicka stays thankful for her life and family — and stays passionate about helping disabled and low-income people thrive.\n\n“I joined to make a difference in the community. And to also be a face in the community and to let people see that people with disabilities are affected too. ”\n-Tamicka Jackson\n\n\nAge:67\nHometown:Washington, D.C.\nBackground:Felicia has experienced food insecurity since her early life. She had an abusive mother who refused to feed her and her siblings on many days. The only meals she ate those days were the free lunches from her school. Her adulthood years were filled with further difficulties, though she’s now retired and seeks to give back to her community.\n\n\n“I joined to tell my story with hunger to hopefully encourage someone anyone that if they’re experiencing food insecurity and need help that’s okay.”\n-Felicia Minick\n\n\nAge:63\nHometown:Washington, D.C.\nNate Jenkins has a big family: he’s a single dad of 15 children, 7 of whom are adopted. He’s a recovering addict, and has had to rely on social services and charitable organization to feed himself and his family. His life has swung from scarcity to abundance and back many times. Nate is passionate about letting people know that food insecurity can impact anyone at any given time — and helping everyone as a result.\n\n“I want to bring awareness to food insecurity at all income levels and to improve policies and services for food distribution in the DC Area.”\n-Nathaniel Jenkins\n\n\nAge:50\nHometown:Washington, D.C.\nKisha is a single disabled mother, and she’s often had to rely on food pantries and social-safety nets to provide for her family. Over the course of her life, she’s often had to beg for basic things — services that were supposed to be present for her in times of crisis were downright dysfunctional She’s passionate about disability rights, housing equality, food security, and social justice.\n\n\n“I felt that joining the CLC would be a great opportunity to further my training, education and advocacy. Food security is just one of many basic human rights that people are denied daily. Social justice and everything that falls under that umbrella is highly important to me. Having access to healthy, safe, nutritious food is simply just one of many key components to better society.”\n-Kisha McDougald\n", "image_filenames": ["blo_164.png", "blo_165.png", "blo_166.png", "blo_167.png", "blo_168.png", "blo_169.png", "blo_170.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Untitled-design-10-300x300.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-300x300.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-300x300.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-300x300.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/5-300x300.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/6-300x300.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Untitled-design-15.png"]}

These Center City PCS students are on a field trip to our garden, where they will spend the day learning about how fresh vegetables get from the garden to their plate.\nThis field trip is the 7th of the year. In the words of Avery Cross, our Food Growing Education Specialist, these trips are designed to “start building a relationship between the students and produce. To help them love healthy food and understand where it comes from.”\n\nAnd it works, too – “I don’t like kale,” one student tells us, “but this salad changed my mind.”\nAvery kicks off every school visit with an introduction to the food bank and to the practice of urban gardening. Her message to students: there are many ways to garden, and it can be an excellent source of healthy food.\nFor students, the visit is a chance to get hands-on with plants and gardening.  An herb identification game teaches that different plants smell and look different, and how to distinguish different herbs.\nNext up: harvesting food from the garden, which was a favorite part of the day for many students. One student said they “loved harvesting and seeing the peppers and other fruits and vegetables around the garden.” This comes through in how they interact with the plants, as they look at the produce in front of them with wonder. Many of them are giggling at the opportunity to harvest food for themselves.\nWhat do you do after harvesting veggies? Eat them!  The menu for this visit included preparing a kale salad, mostly using ingredients that had just been harvested. The students have been engaged so far, but their energy ramps up as everyone gets a turn using the salad spinner.\nThe students work together to combine the ingredients, resulting in three large bowls of delicious kale salad to share.\nAt the end of every field trip, we distribute a survey asking the students what they learned and how they enjoyed the field trip. Six in 10 said they were likely to seek out the food they explored on the field trip! And every student said they enjoyed the visit.

As she did, she shared bit about her life with our team.  ​\nNorkris came to the U.S. in 2020 from her home country of Venezuela with her husband and teenage daughter. Before leaving, she had been a teacher and an administrator with a steady job. But in the U.S., she could no longer find that kind of work. ​\nWith her husband also looking for employment, she took multiple service industry jobs to help make ends meet.  For a long time, she said, she would get up at 4 a.m. to get to her first eight-hour restaurant job in DC, commute to her second job for another eight-hour shift, and then commute back home to Virginia – often arriving at midnight – before doing it all​ over again the next day. The work was hard on her body, with the long hours on her feet causing inflammation in her feet and legs.  ​\n“People like you, who give us help, also give us hope.”— Norkris, CAFB client\nLike so many people in the service industry, Norkris recently had her hours cut back significantly due to changes in the schedule of the restaurant where she worked. Her husband had just found work to help fill in some of the gap, and importantly, his job provided health insurance. But without all of her previous hours, finances are still strained. She said she wasn’t sure about the idea of applying for SNAP benefits, thought that because she is employed, “someone else might need them more than me.” ​\nNorkris shared that her aspiration is to improve her English language skills so that she can once again have the kind of employment – and self-sufficiency – that she had prior to arriving in the US. She was taking classes to work towards that goal, and was surprised to learn that many community colleges have programs that could help people like her, who are working and older than “traditional” college age, to receive additional certifications.​\n“Everyone in this line can be a professional,” she told me as she gestured at the people there. “We just need some information and some help. People like you, who give us help, also give us hope.” ​\nNorkis’ aspirations are indicative of those held by many people across our region who face food insecurity. According to the CAFB’s2023 Hunger Report, more than half of those experiencing hunger wish to get a different job that better uses their existing skillset, and even more individuals would like to train to get new skills that would help them get into a different field of work. ​\nNorkris’s story highlights the importance of looking holistically at the needs of our clients. This begins with food, which can help individuals focus on all other aspects of their lives, and extends to other supports like learning and professional training, that can ultimately help them improve their financial circumstances. Her experience is yet another powerful reminder that when we help our neighbors get the assistance they need across a range of areas, we can play an essential part in helping people to fulfill their potential.", "image_filenames": ["blo_174.png", "blo_175.png", "blo_176.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Norkris-245x300.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Norkris-2.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Norkris-3.jpg"]}
{"title": "An Inside Look: How School Pantries Support Students and Families", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2023/10/19/an-inside-look-how-school-pantries-support-students-and-families/", "date": "October 19, 2023", "content": "ByJosh Mays•October 19, 2023\nThis month, Cresthaven Elementary School’s Ramona Johnson plans to dress up as a pumpkin. Not for a Halloween party: the pumpkin costume is going to join a litany of other costumes – unicorn suits, pizza hats, elf ears, and more – that she uses to make families feel more comfortable accessing the elementary school’s food pantry. By creating a communal welcoming feeling at the school’s food pantry, Johnson is working to ensure students and families there can access the food they need with dignity.\n“Everyone deserves basic human rights,” Johnson says. “And food is basically a human right”.\n\nThe pantry at Cresthaven, located in Silver Spring, Md., is among 43 school pantries that the Capital Area Food Bank has opened across our region, with 11 more in the works this year. Designed to be a consistent and convenient space for families to access food, school pantries are located within the school building and provide a variety of shelf-stable food items for the school community.\nData gathered in our latest Hunger Report shows that households with children in our region continue to be more vulnerable to food insecurity. Households with kids are still 60% more likely to struggle to access enough nutritious food than households without kids.\nTeachers and school administrators see this need too. Karina Dos Santos, the community school liasion at Viers Mill Elementary School, where we partnered to open a pantry last school year, says families have been clamoring for details about when the pantry would reopen this school year. “You have no idea how many text messages I get,” Dos Santos says, “how many times I’m approached and asked” when the pantry is returning.\nFamilies need food support. At the same time, our Hunger Report found that only half of the food-insecure population in our region is accessing the kinds of support offered by food pantries and food banks.\nWhy not? We’ve identified some barriers:\nHere’s where school pantries come in. They can serve a high-need population in a context where:\nThrough our partnerships, the school administrators and teachers can help us reach families within their communities. “I do a lot of engagement and dismissal and arrival,” Dos Santos tells us. And, of course, Johnson’s costumes draw a lot of attention.\nThere’s also a natural sense of convenience. Most of the pantries’ operating hours overlap with either pick-up or drop-off times for students. This allows families to pick up or drop off their children, and pick up food from the pantry on the same trip.\nDignity and the erasure of stigma are significant priorities for many of the people serving these communities. Johnson’s costumes are a visible example,  but this works out in subtler ways as well. Many schools choose to reframe their food pantries as markets – Viers Mill’s is called the “Jaguar Market.” Most importantly, staffers and volunteers work hard to treat every client with kindness and respect. “There’s nothing worse than to be in need and to be embarrassed,” Johnson says.\nThank you to Cresthaven, Viers Mill and the other schools that partner with us through our school pantry program!

Our partnerships with the latter three schools launched this fall.\nThese programs are tailored to each campus: at Montgomery College, we’ve partnered with their administration to identify students with financial need, who then receive gift cards to local grocery stores every other week. This program offers students flexibility to choose the foods they need, in a setting that reduces stigma. Students also have benefited from the work of our Nutrition Education team, which hosted food budgeting and cooking workshops.\nAt each of Montgomery College’s three campuses, we’re also starting to work with the school to support existing food pantries, where students can stop every weekday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and pick up the nutritious food they need to thrive. We also partner with the college on monthly Mobile Markets, which offer free produce and other perishable food.\n\nAccording to Dr. Carmen Poston-Farmer Travis, director of student affairs at Montgomery College, food assistance can play a “key part” of a students’ “toolkit for success” — and we’ve seen that in the data. More than 90% of the participants in the grocery gift card program at Montgomery College saythe program increased their access to nutritious foodandreduced their financial burden. And 71% say they were able towork fewer hours due to the program.\nThe food bank’s support has been a “game changer…the consistency has been incredible,” says Dr. Poston-Farmer Travis. Working together, we have been able to create a landscape of support for the overall well-being of students.\nAt other colleges, we’re also exploring additional program models, like grocery delivery and credits for student dining locations. Grocery delivery can be especially useful for college campuses with low grocery access, as transportation is often an obstacle for students and paid grocery delivery can be expensive.\nThrough partnerships like these, we’re building a coordinated approach to addressing hunger across our region’s campuses, which ultimately will support greater achievement in the classroom and beyond for all of our area’s students.\n\nPart of that work last year included hostingthe inaugural Regional College Hunger Conference, which brought together college leaders, researchers, students, and advocates to share ideas on broad-scale strategies for addressing campus hunger in the long term. That conference, which is co-sponsored by the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area, will return again later this month —learn more here.\nWe are so grateful for our partners at Montgomery College and at campuses across our region – and we are eager to continue the conversation around how to support students and create paths to greater opportunity and brighter futures.", "image_filenames": ["blo_182.png", "blo_183.png", "blo_184.png", "blo_185.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/collegehunger1-300x206.jpeg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/collegehunger3-300x186.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/20221006_CollegeHunger_1119-1-1536x1024-1-300x200.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-6.png"]}

We get hungry multiple times a day. And some of us don’t get to eat multiple times a day.”\nEstella is many things. She’s a student at Northern Virginia Community College, studying child development. She’s a single mother to three wonderful children. She works full-time. And she’s food insecure.\nShe is one of more than 1.2 million residents of the Greater Washington region who experienced food insecurity last year — that’s one in three people. Hunger is here. It’s everywhere — in every county we serve, at least one in six residents reported facing food insecurity. That’s the reason the food bank has launched our“Hunger is Here” public service announcement campaign. Through video, print and digital ads, food bank clients offer viewers a glimpse of what it’s like to experience food insecurity\nHunger is here, but it’s easy to ignore. “It’sone of the most expensive areas,” Estella tells us, “soyou would not think that…someone in this house next door to me has no food to eat or not enough.” People don’t often advertise their experiences with food insecurity. A family’s deep struggles can be entirely invisible to the outside world. Estella elaborates: “This hunger, this food insecurity, is a silent crisis.”\nEstella works full-time, but the money she makes often isn’t enough to feed her family. She’s not alone in that: 76% of food-insecure people in our region are also employed. But for too many, the income earned from working one or more jobs is insufficient to cover the high cost of living — 70% of our food-insecure neighbors are looking for a different job with higher wages.\nShe’s considered quitting school, giving up on burgeoning dreams and opportunities for social mobility. She’s thought “I can’t do this because I’m a mom. I have to feed these kids.”\nShe was struggling especially intensely when she found out about the opportunities for her to access support through the food bank. “As soon as I found out that Capital Area Food Bank was assisting…college students, and that I had resources and access to more pantries and help…I wasn’t scared anymore. It’s like anxiety gone.”\nYou can join our work supporting neighbors like Estella. Start bylearning moreabout the campaign. Hunger is here.

That’s essentially unchanged from the 33% of respondents who reported experiencing food insecurity in the 2022 survey.\n\nIn every county across the region, at least 1 in 6 residents reported experiencing food insecurity.The issue remains most severe in Prince George’s County, where nearly 1 in 2 households reported struggling to access enough food at some point during the prior year.\n\nIt may be surprising to many people thatthe rate of food insecurity has barely budgedat a time when the coronavirus pandemic has come to an end and the overall economic picture has appeared to improve significantly. But the economic gains have not reached everyone equally, leavingmore than 1.2 million people in the regionstruggling to put food on the table.\nThe pandemic’s ongoing economic upheaval, the rollback of expanded government assistance programs intended to blunt the pandemic’s negative effects, and soaring rates of inflation were major drivers of food insecurity among residents of our region, according to the survey.Among those facing food insecurity, more than half reported major impacts from all three of these dynamics.\nTo gather the research that informsHunger Report 2023, the fourth such study issued by the CAFB, the food bank once again partnered with highly trusted independent social research organization NORC at the University of Chicago to conduct a general population surveyof nearly 5,300 residents. It provides a detailed look at who is experiencing food insecurity in the Greater Washington region, how an uneven economic recovery has affected food access, and recommendations that ever sector can take to address these challenges in both the short and longer term.\nRead Hunger Report 2023\nWhat does food insecurity look like across the region? Here’s a snapshot:\n\nProtracted and uneven economic effects of the pandemic:The Capital Area Food Bank’s 2023 study found that people of color, households with children, and those earning less than the median income all reported much more severe impacts from the pandemic than their respective counterparts.\n\n\nThe rollback of pandemic-era government assistance programs: The pandemic caused profound economic turmoil, including widespread job loss and unemployment, and the federal government temporarily increased benefits through programs like SNAP to try to stabilize the economy.\nThe food bank’s survey results make clear the positive impacts of this increase on household budgets and food security for SNAP recipients in our region:70% of SNAP recipients reported that the increase in benefits caused a major, positive impact on their household’s financial situation.\n\nRecord-setting levels of inflation:Unsurprisingly, the survey also found thatan overwhelming majority of adults said inflation or higher than usual prices for housing, food or groceries, utilities, and other goods or prices had at least a minor impact on their financial situation.Those effects were felt most significantly by those whose budgets were stretched thin even before inflation skyrocketed.\n\nAddressing food insecurity and the broad forces that shape it requires both short- and long-term strategies to enable a more equitable economy and pathways to opportunity.\n\nThese include:\nWant to dive deeper?

The bus in question is the Capital Area Food Bank’s summer meals bus, and when it rolls through every weekday at 6 p.m., it brings the whole community together.\nThemobile summer meals servicehas been a lifeline for Carla Claure, who struggled with steady employment amid the pandemic. Carla had worked as a housecleaner, and her husband as a construction worker – two industries that were deeply affected by the economic upheaval. She has three children, two of whom she still needs to feed. But how do you feed your kids without a job?\nEven last summer, she was only able to find work three to four days a week. During that time, the summer meals offered her a “guarantee that my daughters eat something in the day,” Carla says. No matter how tenuous her employment felt, she knew her daughters would be fed.\nThat guarantee came in the form of the food bank’s summer meals bus. It’s a long, green-and-white vehicle that looks like a school bus from the outside. On the inside, it’s been modified to act as a full-service mobile food serving station, with refrigerators, warming closets, and a surprising amount of storage space.\nAt every site, children who need something to eat that evening receive dietitian-approved meals.\nWhen the bus arrives at Audubon, the neighborhood children quickly gather around it. “The most fun is the bus coming and staying here … everybody runs all the way through the community to get to the bus,” Carla says.\nThis summer, Carla has full-time employment. But she still worries about her children getting the food they need as she and her juggle the competing demands of working and caregiving. But every weekday at 6 p.m., she feels the relief of knowing that they have a healthy dinner available to eat.\nThose healthy dinners won’t end as the summer draws to a close. Starting this fall, the mobile meals bus will be providing afterschool meals for families in the Audubon neighborhood and several other neighborhoods in Northern Virginia! Expanding the mobile meal service will help to ensure kids across the region are getting the food they need to thrive.\nPhotos by Les Talusan", "image_filenames": ["blo_200.png", "blo_201.png", "blo_202.png", "blo_203.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/carla-with-bus-300x200.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bus-interior-300x200.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/supervisor-lusk-hands-out-food-2-300x300.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/LesTalusan_CAFB_230628_010.jpg"]}

When school cafeterias are closed, children may have a more difficult time getting the food they need to play, grow, and thrive.\n\n“It is more challenging for parents who … can only pay for rent and maybe some foods, and now they have to think about, ‘Oh, now I gotta feed my child breakfast, lunch and dinner,'” says Josie Valdez, property manager at Audubon Estates, a Fairfax County housing community where the food bank distributes summer meals.\nFood insecurity is a significant problem among children in the Washington region. According to the food bank’s2022 Hunger Report,almost half of the households with kids in our region experience food insecurity. That’s double the rate of households without children. The disparity grows even deeper among households of color with children, with almost two-thirds of those families experiencing food insecurity.\n\nThat’s why summer meals are so important. This summer, the food bank is supporting summer meals sites across D.C., Maryland, and Virginia to distribute free breakfast, lunch, supper, and snacks to children. By the time kids head back to class this fall, we’re expecting to serve 68,000 meals.\nAccording to Valdez, this program provides a valuable support for the parents. “Definitely (the meals) release a lot of the stress financially for the parents, and then also the kids are healthy!”\nWhen the food bank’s mobile meals bus pulls in, kids from the housing development often head to the picnic benches behind her office to eat their sandwiches and sides. They especially love the fruit and juices!\nAt the end of the day, Valdez says “the meals have helped the community so much.”\nWant to learn more about the food bank’s Summer Meals program?

Check out the chart below, and read on!\n\nFirst, our team sources the food.\nIt comes fromlocal farmers like Nia, who will provide enough nutrient-rich, Maryland-grown produce for more than 8,000 meals this year!\n\nIt comes from generous grocery stores like Giant Food, Safeway, and others. It comes from government programs that source commodity foods from growers. It comes from schools and companies that holdfood drives.\nAnd it comes from wholesalers, which help us to provide the volume of food necessary to meet a level of need that still has not returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nOn any given day, our three warehouses in DC, Virginia and Maryland contain nearly 4 million pounds of food! Over the course of a year, they will fill and empty again more than a dozen times over.\n\nHow does the food get to our clients?\nWe’re proud to supply a network of 400 incredible nonprofit partners, who are helping people get the food they need to thrive today!\nThey include many organizations you might be familiar with, likeSOME(So Others Might Eat),DC Central Kitchen, andMartha’s Tablein Washington;Manna Food CenterandShabachin Maryland;Food for Others,ALIVE!, andHaymarket Regional Food Pantryin Virginia.\nBut what about in areas where the food bank doesn’t have a nonprofit partner?\nGreat question. We also distribute food directly into communities where there are limited brick-and-mortar partners available.\n\nWe deliver food directly to communities of seniors who need nutritious meals. We provide meals for kidsduring the summeras well as through afterschool programs during the school year, so children have the food they need to learn and grow.\nAnd each Saturday, we host farmer’s market-style distributions, called Community Marketplaces, where our neighbors can get fresh fruits and vegetables at no cost.\nAnd increasingly, we’re working with other organizations topair food with serviceslike job training, education, and health care that can help to address some of hunger’s root causes. These partners include community colleges and hospitals, like Children’s National Hospital, where we have collaborated on a food pharmacy.\nSo how many people do you reach through all of these programs?\nAll together, the food bank provided the food for 53 million meals last year, supporting the 1.2 million people in our region who weren’t always sure where their next meal would come from.\nWow—that’s a lot of people.\nIt is, and because we help provide nutritious meals for so many people, we’re always focused on ensuring that the food we provide is nutritious and contributes to wellness.\n\nThat sounds like a big impact!\nIt sure is, andYOUmake it all possible.Every dollar can help to provide two mealsfor our neighbors facing hunger —click hereto make your contribution.\nThank you for supporting your neighbors!", "image_filenames": ["blo_215.png", "blo_216.png", "blo_217.png", "blo_218.png", "blo_219.png", "blo_220.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HowCAFBProvidesFood-1024x246.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Beauty-Blooms-Pictures-1-e1700236558863-1024x684.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/51722336821_92f890ca1b_k.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fooddelivery-1024x768-1.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Untitled-design-21-300x208.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/190111_Volunteers_GovtShutdown00012.jpg"]}
{"title": "From Closet to Free Grocery Store: Haymarket Regional Food Pantry", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2023/06/01/from-closet-to-free-grocery-store-haymarket-regional-food-pantry/", "date": "June 1, 2023", "content": "ByJosh Mays•June 1, 2023\nThe Haymarket Regional Food Pantry started in a closet. Over nearly two decades, it has grown to serve tens of thousands of people in Northern Virginia each year – but skyrocketing need from the pandemic and the recent rollback of SNAP benefits has put a strain on the Capital Area Food bank partner organization and its volunteers.\n\nIn 2005, two churches in Prince William County decided to partner and work to address food insecurity in their community. Together, representatives from the St. Paul’s Episcopal Church and St. Katharine Drexel Catholic Church formed the Haymarket Regional Food Pantry.\nThey started serving food from a closet in the Haymarket Town Hall building, distributing it through a small window. At this point, they were serving 27 families on a regular basis. According to the pantry’s Executive Director Eileen Smith, who was a volunteer at the time, “it was all…whatever we have, we will give you.”\nThe food pantry didn’t remain in a closet for long, however. As Northern Virginia grew in population, so did the need for the pantry’s work. They moved from one closet to a larger one. Then to half a townhouse. Then the full house. Then two townhouses. Finally, in early 2020, they opened their current location: a 5,400 square-foot facility.\nAnd they would need every inch of that space. Demand had been steadily decreasing every year since 2014, but when the pandemic began, the need for food assistance soared. The organization distributed food to nearly 20,000 people in 2019 and more than 30,000 people in 2020 – an increase of 61%.\n\nThe team at Haymarket continued to see an increasing number of clients during 2021 and 2022. This year, it’s on track to distribute food to approximately 45,000 people – around 40% more than they served in 2022. Clients are facing the ongoing economic challenges from the pandemic and sustained rates of inflation, which have left so many in our community struggling to make ends meet and to access enough nutritious food.\nWhenthe expanded pandemic-era SNAP benefits came to an end in March, Haymarket saw a new spike in need. During the month after those benefits ended, the pantry reported a 90% increase in new families seeking assistance, and the team added 55 new weekly appointments.\nThe pantry’s team haven’t just expanded the number of people they’re serving; they’ve also changed the model they use to distribute food. Gone are the days of passing out pre-packed boxes of food – now their operation looks more like a free grocery store. People make an appointment to enter the facility and peruse the various offerings there, selecting the options that best serve their needs.\n\nOperating with an approach focused on client choice is no simple task for an organization that reaches tens of thousands of people, especially for one that is 100-percent run by volunteers. The food pantry has 1,100 active volunteers, many of whom are donating their time on a weekly basis. “We have the best volunteers on the planet. We really do,” Smith says.\nThe pantry’s team keeps their eyes fixed on the community they’re serving and the community they’re building through volunteering together. “To me, there is nothing worse than the thought of a kid going to school hungry,” Smith says. Fortunately, she and the pantry’s entire team are working tirelessly to prevent that from happening in their area.\nWe’ve been proud to partner with the Haymarket Regional Food Pantry since 2010. This fiscal year, we’ve helped them provide approximately 30,000 pounds of food, or 25,000 meals, to the community. We can’t wait to see how our partnership evolves in the coming years!\n", "image_filenames": ["blo_221.png", "blo_222.png", "blo_223.png", "blo_224.png", "blo_225.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-01-125740.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-01-125811.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-01-125716-e1685640397106.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Haymarket-Profile-1-300x169.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-01-125622-1.png"]}

This latest cohort of ourClient Leadership Council(CLC) is heading into the final months of the training program with an expanding set of skills to advocate for policies that can improve the lives of those facing food insecurity.\nGet to know several members of the current class and why they’re participating in this year’s program:\n\nAge:35\nHometown:Washington, DC\nBackground:Temidayo Ojo (goes by Temi) was born in Nigeria and moved to the United States more than 6 years ago. She was born into a low-income family and lost her father at a very young age. Her mom did everything she could to provide for her as a single mom and stressed the importance of education. Her mom often skipped meals so that Temi could eat.\nAfter Temi graduated from college in Nigeria, she struggled to find work for many years. She finally decided to immigrate to the U.S. in search of a better employment opportunities. She found employment in DC, but later lost her job during the pandemic. She now working part time and living in DC’s Ward 8. She regularly attends food distributions at Martha’s Table and Bread for the City.\n“I am participating in the CLC to have a sense of purpose and power, and to increase my knowledge about issues impacting my community. The best part of the program so far has been the educational resources and the supportive staff! I now feel more empowered to serve my community thanks to the CLC!”\n-Temidayo Ojo\n\n\nAge:58\nHometown:Triangle, VA\nBackground:Lee was born and raised in Northern Virginia. She comes from a military family, and has two adult children. She has struggled with mental-health disabilities for much of her life, which has made it difficult for her to work full time.\nShe has struggled with homelessness and food insecurity for many years, and is grateful to be enrolled in the CLC where she can learn how to better advocate for herself and her community.\n“Thank you to the Capital Area Food Bank for feeding my body, mind and soul. I have learned so much since I was accepted onto the Client Leadership Council. You are making a very real positive difference in people’s lives, including mine. I am learning how to stand up for myself and those in my community that are being marginalized.”\n-Lee Van Orden\n\n\nAge:51\nHometown:District Heights, MD\nBackground:Cherice is a 51-year-old single mother to a 21-year-old daughter with severe intellectual disabilities. Due to her disabilities, her daughter is unable to live independently and requires round-the-clock care.\nCherice is a lifelong resident of Prince George’s County, and she currently serves on the county’s Housing Authority Board of Commissioners. Due to her own health issues, Cherice is unable to work full time, but does work part time and receives disability payments and SNAP to help support herself and her daughter. She is a tireless advocate for her daughter and others in the community that feel like they don’t have a voice.\n“The CLC has introduced me to a wonderful community of advocates and people with lived experience. I joined the program to be a voice for the voiceless in my community. I serve on the Housing Authority Board for my County, and look forward to using what I have learned with the CLC to continue advocating for the housing and food insecure people in my neighborhood.”\n-Cherice Shannon\n\nAge:35\nHometown:Lorton, VA\nBackground:Alicia is a 35-year-old single mom who lives in Northern Virginia with her three children. She is a survivor of domestic violence and spent time living in a domestic-violence shelter after the violence forced her to become homeless. She is now housed, living with her children, and working part time.\n\n\n“The CLC has helped me to expand my knowledge about the issues faced by families such as mine, and has helped equip me with resources needed to be a strong voice for myself and others. I plan to used my lived narrative and connections made during CLC to advocate for other survivors of domestic violence. ”\n-Alicia Doe\n\n\nAge:47\nHometown:Alexandria, VA\nBackground:Carla lives in Alexandria with her three daughters and two grandchildren. She immigrated to the U.S. from Bolivia more than 20 years ago. The first few years were very difficult for Carla and her family as they learned to speak English and navigate their lives in a new country. During the pandemic, Carla, her family, and her community struggled a lot with massive job layoffs and increasing rates of homelessness and hunger.\nIt was during this time that Carla learned about how widespread food insecurity is in America, and she decided to take action. She and her neighbors formed a group to visit churches and collect food to be able to share to those in need. Since then, Carla has continued to be an advocate for the Latino community in her community and is passionate about giving back.\n“I joined CLC to learn how to mobilize community members to solve problems. After CLC, I want to continue serving as an advocate for my community, especially Latino families that are struggling with barriers to social service programs.”\n-Carla Claure\n\n\nAge:42\nHometown:Woodbridge, VA\nBackground:Shawnte is a single mom to two kids, ages 12 and 6. She is a poet and community activist living in Woodbridge, VA. Shawnte’s husband was killed in an accident in 2011, which turned her entire life upside down. She had to figure out how to pay her mortgage, bills, and keep food on the table by herself.\nShe was able to apply for WIC, SNAP, and child-care assistance, which allowed her and her daughter to remain housed and fed. She is grateful for the support these programs have offered her, and is passionate about advocating for stronger policies so more people in need can receive critical support from these types of programs. Shawnte founded a non-profit dedicated to using poetry to eliminate violence in communities.\n“The CLC has given me so much knowledge and support to rekindle my burnt-out confidence. They have given my voice a platform to finally be heard. After CLC, I plan to continue working as a social worker and activist to change the broken policies that are causing so much poverty and pain in our communities. ”\n-Shawnte Brown\n", "image_filenames": ["blo_226.png", "blo_227.png", "blo_228.png", "blo_229.png", "blo_230.png", "blo_231.png", "blo_232.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Temi-Ojo-Square-1024x1024.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lee-Van-Orden-Square-1024x1024.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cherice-Shannon-Square-1024x1024.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Alicia-Doe-Square-1024x1024.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Carla-Claure-Square-1024x1024.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shawnte-Brown-Square-1024x1024.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230419-CAFBclc-2320.jpg"]}

Understanding this connection, the food bank has long been focused on ensuring that the food we supply is comprised of healthy options.\nOne important way that we keep an eye on the health of the food we distribute is through an inventory ranking system. As products come into our warehouses, we assess them based on salt, sugar, and fiber content, and give them each a score.\nFoods that meet thresholds for being higher in fiber and lower in salt and sugar are considered “wellness foods” because they’re more likely to contribute to overall health.\nLast year,88% of the foods CAFB assessed for nutritional value were classified as contributing to wellness.\n\nThe vast majority of the items made available to our clients are foods that can help make up a healthy diet!\nThe wellness ratings on our foods are shared with partner groups that order groceries from our warehouse, allowing them to see the nutritional value of the items they access through CAFB. Our partner organizations also receive an annual wellness score for the inventory they’ve ordered, giving them greater visibility into how the foods they provide contribute to the health of those they serve.\nTo pair with the nutritious foods made available from CAFB, our team of dieticians and nutrition educators also create and sharerecipes, produce guidesand other resources with partners and clients.

By including items familiar to people from a wide swath of countries and cultures, our clients are more likely to use and enjoy the foods they receive.\n\nOffering these culturally familiar foods is among the ways that the Capital Area Food Bank is increasingly tailoring the foods we’re sourcing to the needs of our clients. We prioritize fresh fruits and vegetables, which too often are cost-prohibitive or unavailable in food deserts, and we highlight for our partner organizations which items on our menu of groceries best support wellness – items that are low in sugar and sodium, and high in fiber.\nSeveral of the culturally familiar items offered on a trial basis – such as coconut milk, instant coffee, tea, and almond milk – have been so popular that they’ve been incorporated into our regular menu of options.\n\nThe most recent additions heading to our network of pantries and other nonprofit partners are sets of cooking spices, accompanied by bottles of vegetable oil.\nSpices and oils are essential tools for preparing meals and can have important cultural significance.

Based on the cost of a meal in our region,individuals enrolled in SNAP lost the ability to purchase an average of 23 meals each month, or nearly a week of meals.\n\nMultiply those missing meals across the number of SNAP recipients in our region – a number that’s likely far higher than the 328,000 estimated from 2019 data. The result?At least 7.5 million fewer meals for SNAP participants throughout DC, northern Virginia and Maryland’s Montgomery and Prince George’s counties.\nNearly as soon as those emergency benefits expired, the food bank’s partner organizations across the region began reporting increases in the number of clients coming through their doors. DC-based Brighter Day Ministries reported a line that swung around the block during a recent distribution and ordered additional food to keep up with demand.\nOthers have noted seeing previous clients who had not sought food assistance in years. Galilee Community Development Corporation, a nonprofit serving Prince George’s County, shared that a veteran who hadn’t visited the food pantry since 2016 called seeking food aid after his SNAP benefits dropped to $23 per month.\nChante Westfield, a mother of three, says she must space out her purchases of meats, fresh produce and eggs; ration meals; and seek more support from a local food pantry.\n\nThis decrease in SNAP comes against the backdrop of the slow, uneven economic recovery from the pandemic and the soaring cost of inflation. Many people who lost their jobs during the pandemic may be back to work, but due to low wages they may still be earning far less than what’s needed to provide enough food for their families due to the high local cost of living.\nAdding to that are the still-elevated food costs resulting from inflation rates at near 40-year highs, as well as the end of other pandemic-era flexibilities and support programs. Combined, those factors are squeezing local families who must make fewer dollars stretch farther.\nThe Capital Area Food Bank is here to support our neighbors by working to keep food flowing into the community.Need food assistance?

She has been receiving disability payments and Supplemental Security Income, as well as other ongoing supports related to her brain injury. Rachelle is passionate about helping others in her community and about social issues that affect veterans.\n“I was joined the Capital Area Food Bank’s Client Leadership Council to learn more about what I can do to take the fight for closing the low-income veteran food insufficiency gap to our policymakers.

The Capital Area Food Bank is helping ensure the children of those families still get the food they need.\nTo fill the evening meal gap, the food bank is part of the federal Child and Adult Care Food Program, which allows us to provide healthy, kid-friendly meals to public recreation centers, residential community centers, and other locations hosting afterschool programs in DC and throughout the region.\n\nThrough these sites, the food bank will serve more than 186,000 afterschool meals this year!\nAmong our longtime partners in this program is Little Lights, a nonprofit that serves students and adults in several of DC’s public housing communities.\n\nEvery day at Little Lights, Cierra Peterson greets each child with a smile as they come through the door.  The daily interactions are special to her, and she knows firsthand how much positive impact it can have on children’s lives.\nAs a former attendee of the program, Cierra says that the program gave her a safe space to learn and grow. After she went off to high school and college, she continued to volunteer at the site as often as she could, and after graduation, she was offered a full-time position as a site coordinator.\nMuch of Cierra’s adult life has been dedicated to helping the next generation of kids at Little Lights. “Our students come to us really excited after school,” Cierra explains. “Each day begins with community time, when we’re able to play games, get to know them, and ask them about their days at school.” Afterwards, the students go through three rotations—homework time, recreation time, and dinner time.\n\nThe food bank delivers meals to Little Lights consisting of a protein, a vegetable, a fruit, grains, and milk. To Cierra, this is one of the most important aspects of the afterschool program, as many of the children are part of families struggling with food insecurity. Some may not have dinner waiting for them at home.\n“While the parents are working, their kids are able to come here and receive a complete meal,” Cierra says. “Their families can be confident that the student is well-fed when they come home in the evening.”\nWith full stomachs, the kids can focus on homework – each child receives tutoring help. Once they finish school work though, it’s off to the recreation room for games and other activities that allow the kids to explore their creativity.", "image_filenames": ["blo_251.png", "blo_252.png", "blo_253.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2.1-Food-Distribution-Kids-After-School-Card-4-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Little-Lights-square.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design-4.png"]}

More than 50 years later,Action in Community Through Service, or ACTS, continues to find ways to be responsive to changing needs in the community.\nDuring 2022, the food bank provided the food for nearly 800,000 meals to ACTS. That food in turn went out to the roughly 600 families who came through the organization’s doors each month.\n“We have benefited greatly from the relationship with Capital Area Food Bank,” Shirley says. “The programs that are offered have really, especially during COVID, …been helpful.”\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit, causing many nonprofits in the food bank’s network to temporarily shutter even as need in the region increased dramatically, ACTS’ recently built warehouse enabled them to serve as a hub, assisting smaller groups in getting food to a wide radius of children, families and adults who needed it.\nThe food donations that ACTS received from other sources were shrinking during that time, and the food bank was able to increase its support, keeping supplies steady.\nDuring 2021, the food bank sent ACTS 50% more food compared to the previous year, with that tally growing again in 2022.“We’re small enough we can be nimble, but we’re big enough to serve a large community,” says Shirley Couteau, program manager at ACTS, which also offers resources for those struggling to access housing or who have been victims of domestic violence.\nACTS is among 450 partner organizations working with CAFB to distribute food throughout DC, Maryland and northern Virginia.\nThat nimbleness allows the organization to try out new strategies, such as working with the food bank on ways to offer clients more choices in what they’re eating. A new intake form allows incoming clients to indicate if there are foods they would prefer or ones they would not like to receive, offering a more customized approach.\nAnd in addition to providing meals to meet the immediate needs of neighbors in Northern Virginia, the team at ACTS has also been eager to team up on pilot programs focused on addressing overall health through nutrition. Working closely with patients referred from GPW Health Center, ACTS provides fresh produce and healthy shelf-stable items, accompanied by recipe cards from the food bank’s nutrition education team.\n“Having the ability to provide minimally processed and culturally familiar foods for our clients is very important to us,” Shirley says. “We are eager to partner with CAFB in health and wellness programs because it gives us opportunities to not only make more of these foods available to our neighbors but also to provide guidance on preparing the foods healthfully.”\nProviding healthy options that also empower clients with choices that meet their specific needs is a priority for ACTS, and the food bank has been excited to share ideas and resources as it continues this longtime partnership.", "image_filenames": ["blo_267.png", "blo_268.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/acts2-1024x768.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20200728-ASPCapitolArea-0036-scaled.jpg"]}

Now they can also do so when picking up their youngest children, as CAFB expands its partnerships to team up with early-childhood learning centers.\nAt two early-childhood centers in Prince George’s County, parents now can pick up fresh produce provided by the food bank during once-a-month Family Markets. The monthly markets give families the ability to choose the foods they need and want, from items designed to meet the nutritional needs of young children.\n\nThe expansion to early-childhood learning centers is part of the food bank’s broader initiative to address gaps in food access among children and young adults. The food bank’s latestHunger Reportfound households with children in our region are twice as likely to be affected by food insecurity. In addition to expanding food access among preschool-aged children, the food bank also is rapidly increasing the number of Family Markets hosted at local schools as well as launching School Pantries that offer regular access to shelf-stable items.\nOne of these new monthly markets is hosted with the Easterseals Head Start location at Marlboro Pike, a partner that offers high quality, no-cost programming to prepare children for kindergarten and help their families achieve self-sufficiency. The site reaches more than 127 Maryland families each month, in an area where accessing a range of fresh, healthy food can be a challenge. This partnership between CAFB and Head Start helps fulfill Easterseals’ mission to enrich lives for all children in our shared community.\n“The monthly magnitude of fresh fruits and vegetables that we get, the families love it,” says Janelle McGhee, Easterseals’ family service and health supervisor. “There’s always something in the mix with the wow factor.”\nThe broad array of fruits and vegetables offered at the market is important: the more exposure that children have to different foods, the more likely they are to try and to enjoy a range of healthy options as they grow.\nAt the Easterseals early-childhood learning center, staffers have seen that play out at lunchtime. Mikaela Ober Schuster, senior director of corporate relations, said that during one recent lunchtime, the young children were excitedly eating spinach salads.\n“The holistic approach of having the food at school, having the food at home, having recipes, getting to experience that food … It’s all part of setting those healthy boundaries, healthy food practices at a young age,” Ober Schuster says. “And the Capital Area Food Bank is helping us do that.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_269.png", "blo_270.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Head-Start-Family-Market-scaled-e1674076691375.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20210909-FANOida-0908-1-1-scaled-e1674532097892.jpg"]}

During 2022 alone, nearly 13,000 volunteers donated their time and labor, logging more than 30,000 hours of work in our warehouse and Urban Demonstration Garden.\nMeet two of those volunteers, David and Bonnie, who carve time out of their schedules each month to help provide good food today:\n\nWhen David Spence moved to Washington a year and a half ago, he was looking at places where he could give back. Among those options was the Capital Area Food Bank.\nWhen weighing how he would donate his time, David says he really liked how well-organized and efficient the food bank is, as well as how both staff and volunteers are so friendly, inclusive and hard working. Now David tallies three to four volunteer shifts each week, logging more than 400 hours in the food bank’s warehouse.\n“Working at CAFB, I have learned how many people in such a wealthy region experience real food insecurity and do not know where their next day’s meal will come from,” David says. “I can’t imagine how difficult that would be, and I put myself in those shoes and I want to help.”\nDuring his volunteer shifts, David assembles boxes, packs food items, and sorts donations. He is quick to show new volunteers how to do things to keep operations running smoothly.\n“If I see a way I can help a new volunteer or otherwise do something to make a process more efficient, I pitch in,” he says. “When I’m filling boxes at the belt, I use any slow time to break down other people’s boxes, open up the cellophane-wrapped pallets or sweep the floor.”\nVolunteering has always been a big part of David’s life. In Omaha, he volunteered at Heartland Area Food Bank, and he has mentored Sudanese and Afghan refugees over the years. A cancer survivor, he also raises money for cancer patients and research organizations through an organization he founded.\n“I try to empathize and understand what it is like to be in someone else’s shoes and better appreciate what their suffering feels like,” he says. “I feel it is extraordinarily important to try to alleviate others’ suffering, which comes in so many forms.”\n\nBonnie Jackson has been a Capital Area Food Bank volunteer since 2017, when she began volunteering on Saturdays while employed full time. After pausing during the pandemic, she resumed volunteering earlier this year. During a typical month, Bonnie, who is now retired, logs several volunteer shifts at the food bank.\nBonnie first learned about working with CAFB from her workplace. “There were big boxes for food donations in the hallways and on several floors during a food drive,” she said.\nShe signed up for a Saturday volunteering shift “and really enjoyed it,” she says. “I liked the other volunteers I worked with, as well as the staff, and all of our volunteer activities ran smoothly.”\nBonnie says she also likes the flexible shift options, and the amount of work that volunteers put in during their shifts. Like David, she volunteers in the main warehouse, sorting donated food, building food boxes, and filling those boxes for clients.\n“It amazes me how many people come to the food bank during the work week to volunteer,” Bonnie says. “Each shift has several dozen volunteers of all ages and from all sorts of backgrounds.”\nBonnie previously has volunteered tutoring students in reading, and she regularly signs up to assist with an annual Safeway event serving free Thanksgiving meals at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. She and hundreds of other volunteers together serve nearly 5,000 people.\n“I have been blessed with many years of work and opportunities, and now is the time to pay it forward and give back,” she says. “I enjoy giving back to the community. The food bank is a great place for people to volunteer because there is a need for people in the DC area to have access to nutritious food.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_275.png", "blo_276.png", "blo_277.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/David-Spence-1024x812.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Bonnie1-880x1024.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Volunteer-week-4-scaled.jpg"]}

The survey also showed that they are seeking more fresh, healthy foods.\nWith the new van, the Grocery Plus team canoffer longer time frames for picking up boxes at senior housing centers and other locations that limited staffing and storage capabilities.The van’s schedule also includes a new delivery location at a veterans housing center.\n“It gives us the ability to be nimble,” says Marian Peele, senior director of the food bank’s Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which is known as Grocery Plus in DC and My Groceries to Go! in Maryland.\nSince August, the new van has logged 1,000 miles driven and more than 1,200 boxes delivered, reaching more than 250 to 300 seniors each month. Between the van and existing distribution efforts, the food bank is now reaching more than 5,400 seniors through the program – more than it has in several years through Grocery Plus.\nThe van was among several efforts this year to better meet the needs of local seniors. In response to the survey results showing a desire for more fresh, healthy foods, CAFB also helped provide more produce to participants by helping several program sites add refrigeration for storing fruits and vegetables.\nThese changes are appreciated by seniors like Frank Myers, a Washington, DC, resident and longtime participant in the program. “Everybody needs apples, oranges, bananas,” Frank said. ” The produce is very helpful.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_278.png", "blo_279.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Grocery-Plus-van-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Grocery-Plus-van-scaled.jpg"]}

Willard and Alice S. Marriott Foundation — involved building a new outdoor teaching kitchen adjacent to CAFB’s existing garden. The new kitchen space includes a sink, a stove top, a grill, fridge space, and a pizza oven.\n“Now we can directly use what we’re harvesting,” says Avery Cross, CAFB’s Food Growing Education Specialist. “We have a space here to bring it over, cook with it, and enjoy it.”\nIncorporating cooking demonstrations alongside the garden gives visitors another way to become familiar with the produce they see in the garden. Not only do they learn how certain foods grow, but also how to use those fresh, nutritious foods in their own kitchens.\n\nCompleting the outdoor kitchen space are new tables and flooring, turning an underutilized area into a more accessible one for visitors to participate in a broader range of outdoor programming.\nIn addition to building the new kitchen, the recent renovation project also included overhauls to the demonstration garden itself.\n\nThe garden beds included a variety of new plants this year.New trees and holly plants now line the edge of the garden, and a new fence, walking path and lights make the space more welcoming and easier to use for the garden team and the volunteers contributing their labor.\nThe food bank’s garden is not only looking great. It’s also more productive than it has been in years, churning out 1,200 pounds of produce! Most of that haul has gone to CAFB’s partner organizations, who distribute it to neighbors across the region.\nThe remainder has been used for demonstrations by the food bank’s nutrition education team. Herbs from the garden have gone into tea brewed in the adjacent kitchen, and a recent workshop showcased multiple ways to use fresh beets.\n\nThe garden team also hosted their firstmiddle-school group since the renovations were completed. The fall visit, supported through a grant from The Wills Group, included learning firsthand how the garden is maintained, the role of photosynthesis in the growing process, what it’s like to harvest vegetables, and finally using those fresh veggies in a pizza.\nThe food bank also held agardenlaunch party in October, celebrating the renovationsand kicking offthe first of many community gatherings in the new educational space.\n\nAs the garden team winds down this growing season and prepares for the colder months, they’re already preparing for next year and how to make the most out of their new tools.

But a growing number of college students are finding it increasingly difficult to access the nutritious foods they need to be successful in pursuing their diploma.\nDuring the first-ever Regional College Hunger Conference, hosted by the Capital Area Food Bank and the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area, students like Estella Redding shared the strains they’ve felt in staying on top of their studies while also feeding their families. For too long, Estella — who is raising three children while pursuing her degree from Northern Virginia Community College — didn’t know about, or wasn’t eligible for, programs intended to help someone in her situation.\n“Stress is a major barrier to success,” Estella says. “In order to focus on my academics, easing the stress of not having food for my family was critical.”\nDuring the recent daylong conference hosted on the campus of the Catholic University of America, nearly 100 leaders, students, and advocates from 15 institutions came together to share ideas and discuss a common vision for ensuring that students like Estella across the region can find the support they need.\n“Higher education can unlock worlds of potential, but for far too many college students, food insecurity is a barrier to academic success,” said Radha Muthiah, CAFB’s president and CEO. “Through our partnership with the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area, we’re beginning a dialogue that will enable a coordinated approach to addressing hunger across our region’s campuses, ultimately supporting greater achievement in the classroom and beyond for all of our area’s students.\n“Increasingly, those seeking higher education do not fit the “traditional” model of a college student. They are frequently older, financially independent, employed either part or full time, and raising families. These strains on time and resources are further compounded by the rising cost of tuition and daily necessities.\nLocally and across the country, rates of food insecurity on college campuses are rising. According toa national-level survey from The Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice at Temple University, 34% of college students have experienced food insecurity within the last year.\nFor several years, the Capital Area Food Bank has collaborated with institutions of higher education on a variety of initiatives and programming that support students experiencing food insecurity. These include on-campus pantries, home delivered groceries, and credits for campus meals. Participating students say these programs enable them to focus on their academic success and well-being.\nThis fall’s Regional College Hunger Conference was the next step in this work. As attendees discussed the food-insecurity challenges at each of their campuses and organizations, several key themes emerged, including a need to focus on:\n◼ De-stigmatizing campus hunger by building a culture in which every community member sees this challenge as one they are solving together.\n◼️ Dedicate resources to the work that will make it sustainable. Student-run efforts can be an important part of the picture, but programs need staff and funding to ensure consistency.\n◼️ Centering student needs, experience, and dignity in program design and implementation. Attention to nutrition security, not just food access, is critical to ensure the food that students receive can keep them healthy, not just full.\n◼️ Engaging the full range of campus offices and resources – from financial aid to housing and student life – to make student support more seamless and accessible.\nWe’re looking forward to continuing our collaboration with those in the higher-education space, so that no student in our area has to choose between putting food on the table and achieving their full potential.", "image_filenames": ["blo_291.png", "blo_292.png", "blo_293.png", "blo_294.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221006_CollegeHunger_1119-1-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221006_CollegeHunger_0795-1-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221006_CollegeHunger_0117-1-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221006_CollegeHunger_0012-1-1-scaled.jpg"]}

They include many organizations you might be familiar with, likeSOME(So Others Might Eat),DC Central Kitchen, andMartha’s Tablein Washington;Manna Food CenterandShabachin Maryland;Food for Others,ALIVE!, andSERVEin Virginia. They also include some you may not have heard of likeDamien Ministries.\nThen what happens?\nOur partners receive that food and get to work getting it to people who need it.\nYou mean CAFB provides food to all those places?\nWe do! We’re proud to supply a network of incredible partners across our region who are helping people get the food they need to thrive today. And increasingly, we’re working with other organizations topair food with serviceslike job training, education, and health care that can help to address some of hunger’s root causes.\nBut what about in areas where the CAFB doesn’t have a partner non-profit to help meet the need?\nGreat question. When there is no partner who can do it, our drivers roll up in a big 18-wheeler and deliver groceries right into the neighborhood.\n\nWe deliver food directly to communities of seniors who need wholesome meals.\nAnd we set up farmer’s market style fruit and vegetable markets where folks in need can get healthy produce at no cost.\nAll told, the food bank will provide the food for 45 million meals this year (50% more than pre-pandemic).\nThe Capital Area Food Bank provides the ingredients for good meals to support the nearly half a million people in our region who aren’t always sure where their next meal will come from.\n\nWow—that’s a lot of people.\nIt is, and because we help provide nutritious meals for so many people, we’re always focused on ensuring that the food we provide is nutritious and contributes to wellness.\nThat sounds like a big impact!\nIt sure is, andYOUmake it all possible.\nThank you for supporting your neighbors!", "image_filenames": ["blo_295.png", "blo_296.png", "blo_297.png", "blo_298.png", "blo_299.png", "blo_300.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Final-CAFB-Trifold-Brochure-2-copy-2.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/kevin-with-produce.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fooddelivery-1024x768-1.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20200728-ASPCapitolArea-0924-1-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Header_Cathy-scaled.jpg"]}

{"title": "CEO’s Reflections: Summer Meals and Future Dreams", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2022/08/15/ceos-reflections-summer-meals-and-future-dreams/", "date": "August 15, 2022", "content": "ByRadha Muthiah•August 15, 2022\nOn a recent evening, I found myself surrounded by the energy of children enjoying a warm summer night. We were at an event for the food bank’sSummer Meals program, and kids were running by on all sides – heading to get their faces painted, play football with the DC Divas, and of course, eat dinner.\nVisiting with our partners and clients is one of the best parts of my job, and as pandemic restrictions have eased, it’s something I have been eager to get back to. Upon arriving, I spotted a group of women sitting at a table, chatting as they watched the happy chaos, and sat down to join them.\nThe woman next to me was the grandmother of one of the girls playing nearby, and as we spoke I learned that she had emigrated from Guatemala a little over 10 year ago. She came to the area to be with her son and daughter in law, and to help take care of their two kids (her granddaughter and a younger grandson).\n\nLike so many people in our region, the pandemic had impacted them financially. Her son works as an auto repair specialist, a job that she said generally helps pay the bills when work is plentiful. As the number of people driving declined in recent years, however, so did his income. Her daughter in law also works, cleaning homes in the area. In the spring of 2020, that work started to feel dangerous. Her grandson was just a newborn at the time, and her daughter in law curtailed many of her cleaning jobs to limit the risk of getting him or others in the house sick.\nWith reduced income, they made ends meet by pooling food and other resources with neighbors when they needed to. And when that wasn’t enough, she said, they would periodically seek assistance from places that they knew and trusted, like the neighborhood recreation area we were currently sitting in that makes meals available for her grandkids over the summer through its partnership with the food bank.\nShe had missed spending time with her neighbors during the last few years of COVID isolation, she told me, and that on that evening, she was as glad for being surrounded by her community as she was for the food.\n\nWhile we talked, her granddaughter Claudia – a bubbly little girl with a painted butterfly adorning her face – came and sat next to me, gently pulling my sleeve to get my attention. When I asked how old she was, she held the fingers on her hand outstretched, plus one more on her other hand: a very proud six years!\nShe was entering first grade in the fall, and when asked, she offered that what she had liked most about kindergarten was that “the teachers made us all stand in straight lines for recess, so all those disorganized boys got out the door sooner and didn’t cost us any fun time.” She expressed hope that her new teachers would adhere to these same fun-maximizing practices.\nWe chatted for a while longer about the foods she liked. She was considering the vegetables on her plate, saying she liked them “ok” and deeming them mostly edible. But pizza and tater tots, she said, were much more her speed. After a few more bites, she ran off for more play.\n\nAs the evening wound down I said goodbye to my table companions and headed out. Driving home, I was filled with gratitude at having been able to connect with so many people that evening. I was also filled with resolve.\nI felt resolve for continuing to do more to support the growth and health of kids like the ones I had spent time with that night. That little girl’s spunk – her joy and sparkle – is something I hope she never loses. Among many other things, that will require that she has consistent access to nutritious food (and a desire to eat it) to help her grow up to meet her potential. Our programs for kids are an essential part of that, and as we focus more on young children, we can design even more tailored and effective ways of reaching them and helping them form lifelong healthy eating habits.\nI also felt resolve for doing more to help and empower people like the grandmother I’d spoken with, and her children. In the short term, how can we ensure they have a trusted web of community resources around them, and that they can access the supports and programs available to assist them?  Longer term, how can we address some of the challenges that can make putting a meal on the table difficult, despite how hard they’re working?\n\nThe food bank’s “Food Plus” initiatives, which pair food with additional services to help aid in our neighbors’ economic mobility, is an important start, as is our advocacy work to expand eligibility for key government programs. But there is still enormous untapped possibility that can be unlocked by expanding our partnerships across the region with diverse organizations ranging from universities to corporate employers to other nonprofits.\nI am incredibly proud of the food bank’s work – that we can be that trusted community partner for so many people. And I am also reminded, whenever I spend time with those we serve, how much remains to be done, and of the urgency of finding new ways to help all of our neighbors thrive.\n\nPhoto credits: Les Talusan", "image_filenames": ["blo_302.png", "blo_303.png", "blo_304.png", "blo_305.png", "blo_306.png", "blo_307.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LesTalusan_CAFB_220707_061-1-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LesTalusan_CAFB_220707_073-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LesTalusan_CAFB_220707_065-2-scaled-e1660594943547.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LesTalusan_CAFB_220706_029-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LesTalusan_CAFB_220707_058-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LesTalusan_CAFB_220707_065-2-scaled-e1660594943547.jpg"]}

Her mission is to help ensure the kids in her community have enough food to eat.\n“I’m interested in helping kids grow in a positive way,” Loretta says. “So if by serving food helps them, that’s what I do.”\nThat mission involves teaming up with the Capital Area Food Bank, which has worked with her employer, City Gate, for more than a decade to provide breakfast and lunches to kids throughout the summer.\nCity Gate, which serves summer meals at the Mary Virginia Merrick Recreation Center in DC’s Ward 8, is among 30 sites where the food bank partners with community groups all summer long to provide free meals and snacks to all kids.\nFor too many children, school may provide the only nutritious meals they receive on a given day. When summer break starts, kids lose that critical lifeline.\nTo help connect more kids with meal sites this summer, the Capital Area Food Bank has launched webpages with interactive maps to help families locate sites near them:KidsMealsDMV.organdComidasParaNinos.org.\n\nLoretta says she does see more kids struggling to get enough food during the summer months. The kids who come to her meal site “want to eat right away,” she says. Toward the end of the month, when families may see support from public-assistance programs running out, she also notices more children coming through the door at mealtimes.\n“There’s no money for things like food. That’s sad to say,” Loretta says. “But they know if they come here … that I can get me a lunch, I can get me a snack, I can get dinner.”\nLoretta tries to build upon the love of food that she sees in the kids she serves. She’s started a cooking club to help kids who struggle with fractions. After all, she says, cooking “is all about numbers.”\nShe also keeps a stash of cookies as a reward for those who help pick up trash or aid her with other tasks that keep the program running.\nOn a recent muggy afternoon, the food on the lunch menu was followed up by frozen treats.\n“These kids are well-fed thanks to the food bank,” she says.", "image_filenames": ["blo_308.png", "blo_309.png", "blo_310.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LesTalusan_CAFB_220630_009-2.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LesTalusan_CAFB_220630_003-2.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Loretta-featured-image.png"]}

Swiping her meal-plan card may be a typical college experience, but for Rebecca, it will bring a long-sought sense of relief and certainty about where she is finding her daily meals.\nThroughout her childhood, Rebecca’s family struggled with food insecurity. Her mom was a single parent who struggled to make ends meet as she supported two daughters, and later, a husband who was unable to work due to a disability.\n“She did the best that she could to let me and my sister have three meals a day, but it was hard,” Rebecca recalledrecently. “Even if you weren’t content or satisfied, you just had to, you know, you just had to be until the next meal.”\nPublic-assistance programs offered little help. Her mother, a Nigerian immigrant, applied for free and reduced school lunches for Rebecca and her sister,butthe forms were often confusing and eligibility requirements were sometimes unclear.\nSummers were also tough, she says. When school was out of session, “we were pretty much on our own” when it came to finding food. Her family wasn’t familiar withprograms like those that the food bank runs with partner organizationsto keep kids fed throughout the summer.\n“We never really went hungry, where it was like, we didn’t eat for days,” she says. “There were just so many unknowns, like would there be food tomorrow? Or how can we afford the next grocery bill?”\nAs her mother worked as a home health aide and attempted to navigate confusing aid programs, Rebecca put pressure on herself to help financially.\n“I felt so bad watching my mom with no help whatsoever,” Rebecca says. “I just couldn’t wait to help and support. I forced myself to grow up and mature.”\nAt age 14, the Germantown, Md., resident got a job at Rita’s Italian Ice to help supplement her mother’s income. But amid the pandemic, Rebecca and her mother both had to leave their jobs, leaving the family again in a precarious position.\nEventually, Rebecca became involved with Bethel Campus Fellowship, a youth Christian organization that is among the food bank’s many partner organizations across the region. It was through Bethel Campus Fellowship that Rebecca heard aboutthe food bank’s Client Leadership Council. As a member of the second CLC cohort, Rebecca says she’s learned strategies for how she can use her voice as an advocate to represent her peers going through similar struggles.\nRebecca plans to use her advocacy skills on campus this fall at Salisbury University, where she wants to be involved in efforts to end hunger on college campuses.\nOne idea she’s already excited to work on? An initiative that would allow students to donate any leftover credits from that semester’s meal plan, so those who can’t afford a meal plan could access donated meals during the next semester.\n“The meal plans are actually really, really, really expensive,” Rebecca says, adding that she was only able to afford one because of scholarships that covered the cost.\nThere was “a sense of relief” within her when she learned that her scholarships would pay for the meal plan. Like her peers, Rebecca will be able to focus on finding the classes and professors that will help her achieve her goals.\n“I can worry about normal things,” she added. “I feel like a normal student.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_311.png", "blo_312.png", "blo_313.png", "blo_314.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rebecca-CLC-2-e1657287864265.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rebecca-CLC-1-e1657287989131.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/52177355796_1125dcfa48_o-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rebecca-blog-featured-image.png"]}

In a conversation with CAFB, she shared her experiences with navigating food- and housing-assistance programs, as well as what she’s gained from involvement in the CLC program.\nAfter graduating from the program next month, Neijan plans to continue using her voice to advocate for herself and others so that everyone can access the tools they need to not just to survive, but thrive.\nI like to advocate for people who can’t advocate for themselves.\nWhen it comes to food poverty, I looked at the class like this, and I took it maybe a different way from other people…People don’t have food. Okay, that is very much so understandable. Then you go to people like social services, and they [give] you food stamps. And you’re like, ‘Okay, well, I got food stamps, but I don’t have a house. So I’mma get all these food stamps, and what am I going to do with them? How am I supposed to make sure I have a hot meal everyday? Do I have to go to 7/11 and warm up noodles or get a $5 pizza because I don’t have the home to go home to to actually cook food? So I got to eat cold food.’\nIt’s like, ‘Okay, y’all giving me the food—that’s cool…But…I need more than just that’…They look at it like, ‘You don’t have a job. You don’t have this. Oh, we can’t do this for you. We can give you, like, $200 in food stamps every month, and you just gotta make it work.’ Like, why would you do that—if you’re not going to help them prosper even more knowing, possibly, they could have a disability?…They look at it like, ‘Well, we gave you food.’…But did you help me get an apartment? Did you help me get in a shelter, in a hotel? Did you help me do any of that? No, you didn’t. And I know too many people that have disabilities and are in Fairfax County, in Virginia, that are not getting the help that they need.\nI know a young lady right now. She was in a situation. She just got out of [it], but I advocated for her as much as I possibly could when it came to talking to social workers, talking to people at shelters to get her where she’s at now…She just moved into a one-bedroom apartment. So, not only was it my voice that help[ed] her, but she put the work in as well to do it. And I will possibly say if it wasn’t for me advocating for her, I don’t think she would be where she’s at right now.\n“You gotta fight for what you need and what you want. If you don’t fight for it, you’re not gonna get it.”\n– Neijan Boyd, Client Leadership Council member\nI finally got my apartment. So I’m about to move in…And not only was I [advocating for the friend who was working to secure housing], and I’m in my own situation, but I made sure that I didn’t allow my situation to [override]…what I had to help her do because that was in my heart to do that.\nI just went to the…Capital Area Food Bank on Puerto Rico Avenue, and…when I tell you that helped me so much….When those food stamps are gone and you need food and those boxes come, [they] help…All those canned goods go with whatever you got in that [re]frigerator or that freezer. They give you everything that you need to survive [until] the next time you get your food stamps…I also go to one out here called Food for Others…They give you meat, milk—like everything that you need.\nBeing able to put more gas in our car because…gas prices are extremely high right now. And also toiletries, like tissues, paper towels, soap, toothpaste, toothbrush, stuff like that that you need.\nSurvival. Back when I was younger, it was me plus five [siblings], so it was a lot of us. And my mom, she only got but so much in food stamps. And so we had to survive off what we had.\nWe love cereal with ice cubes in it. I don’t know why. But if we could have a lot of boxes of cereal and a whole lot of milk, we would be good.\nThe people in these offices—social services, housing—they can help you. They choose not to…You gotta go out there next to get what you need. You can’t give up because once you give up, they take it as, ‘Oh see, she didn’t need it,’ or ‘He doesn’t really need the help anyways because if they did, they would’ve fought a little bit harder’…Me and my kids are just now getting a housing voucher, and my son is seven years old, and I’ve been in a shelter-house program since 2017…You gotta fight for what you need and what you want.

In some counties, nearly half of all residents experienced food insecurity at some point last year. In every county, at least one in five people faced challenges getting enough to eat.\n\nThe breathtaking findings in our new survey are the first publicly available information about the scale of food insecurity in the Greater Washington region during the past year. Together, the responses underscore how the long-standing inequities across our region were exacerbated by the pandemic’s uneven economic effects.\nWhile one-third of local households are earning more than before the public health crisis began, two in three have seen their income remain flat or decline – creating a substantial short-term strain as the cost of food and other necessities have skyrocketed, and the potential for lingering financial effects in the absences of broad action to address inequities.\nRead Hunger Report 2022\nThis year’s analysis is the third Hunger Report conducted by CAFB, following reports in2020and2021.

The result is a survey of nearly 4,000 residents across our region, which offers the most detailed look to date at the prevalence and underlying factors of food insecurity locally. (Read more hereon how the survey was conducted.)\nDue to differences in methodology, these data cannot be accurately compared to previous studies on regional food security. However, the findings clearly show food insecurity to be much more widespread across the region than previously understood.\nBelow is a recap of the report’s key findings, as well as recommendations for ways to create greater food security and economic stability for more people in our region.\nThe sheer prevalence of food insecurity across the regionshown in the survey results is among the most significant takeaways. Usingthe USDA’s standard screener, the survey found33% of individuals across the region were food insecure at some point during the last year. Among that group, half were classified as “severely food insecure,” the most acute tier.\nThe need for greater access to food affects every community across the region, but not all communities or demographic groups are affected equally. People of color and households with kids are disproportionately affected:\n\nYoung adults aged 18–29 also are overrepresentedamong those who are food insecure: they accounted for 31% of the population experiencing food insecurity, despite totaling 21% of the general population.\nPeople experiencing food insecurityare employed at the same rateas those who face challenges accessing enough food: 77% of people facing food insecurity were employed, compared to 74% of those who did not experience food insecurity.\nA third of our region is earning less than they were in March 2020.Food-insecure people are significantly overrepresented in this group.\n\nWhen asked about their own projections of whether their household finances would improve or worsen over the next year, most people across the region are not optimistic.\n\nMost adults agree that governments of all levels bear the largest responsibility for addressing food insecurity in the United States. However, nonprofit organizations are seen as the agencies doing the most to address food insecurity.\nThe study’s findings indicate there is still a major gap in access to high-quality employment opportunities. More than half of food-insecure adults would experience a major positive impact on their household finances from gaining access to higher-quality jobs, according to the survey findings.\nThe food bank has a series of pilot initiatives based on this final concept. Known as“Food+” programs, the food bank partners with hospitals and clinics, colleges and universities, and other social service organizations to pair food access with existing programs focused on health care, education and workforce development.\nThe data are clear: inequity has grown during the pandemic, and the valley between the realities of those at different income levels is set to continue widening. What is needed now are accelerated efforts to address those expanding inequities.", "image_filenames": ["blo_318.png", "blo_319.png", "blo_320.png", "blo_321.png", "blo_322.png", "blo_323.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IUOmRtWQ.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IUOmRtWQ-1.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SecureVSInsecure.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/employmentbywagelevel.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/keyissues.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/HR2022-featured-image-1.png"]}

When Latisha was a child growing up in Washington, DC, those hardships included trauma and abuse, along with assault. In adulthood, she has faced homelessness and a Stage 2 breast cancer diagnosis, which in turn made it difficult to cover expenses like food.\n“Whatever obstacles I face, I’ve always been too stubborn to give up on myself,” she says. Experiencing those personal challenges contributed to her desire to fight for greater food security in the Greater Washington area, including through her involvement with the Capital Area Food Bank’sClient Leadership Council.\nAlong with two of her sons, Latisha has been volunteering at CAFB for more than a decade. When she heard about the Client Leadership Council, she says, she was eager to join in.\nThe advocacy program “has been really beneficial,” she says. “It’s given me confidence, and I know it has others as well.”\nOne of her advocacy goals through the CLC is to work withCAFB’s Curbside Groceries programto bring the service to more neighborhoods throughout the District—including where she lives in Ward 5.\nThe program, which already operates in Ward 8 and in Prince George’s County, offers fruits, vegetables, dairy products and other staples to those who may not be able to easily reach a grocery store.\n“It would be a great option, because not everyone has access to vehicles,” says Latisha.\n\n“And they have children. So it’s difficult to get on transportation with two, three, four children to the grocery store—and then they have groceriesandchildren,” she says.\n“So it would be a great time saver,” she says. “And a convenience!”\nLatisha began working with Curbside Groceries after staffers involved in the program conducted a focus group with CLC members. She’s started to meet with community stakeholders to gauge their support for bringing the grocery truck to her area.\n“So far, the feedback has been overwhelming,” she says.  “I hope to see this come to fruition and grow from here.”\nLatisha wants to give back to her community because she knows what it’s like to have to make hard calls about how to afford necessities.\n“One of the toughest things in the world is [when] you have just enough to pay the bills, not enough to buy food. And you’re juggling, and you have to make that decision,” she says.\n“It’s like walking a tightrope,” she continues.\n“You have that stress, because you know your child is hungry, and you have an empty refrigerator or cupboards. What do you do?” she says. “You really don’t want to continue to borrow and push yourself deeper in debt, because you know that the next pay period, you’re still facing the same bills.”\nThat’s where organizations like CAFB have come in, Latisha says: “They’ve been the bridge, and they’ve made the difference.”\nOverall, she says, she would like policymakers and others across the region to understand how prevalent food insecurity and hunger are in the community.\n“People don’t think it happens in their backyard,” she adds.\nStill, Latisha says she’s hopeful that the situation will improve.\n“For us as a whole, as a community, with programs like the CLC, and Capital Area Food Bank, it will improve for us all—if we continue working together collectively to help others,” she says.", "image_filenames": ["blo_324.png", "blo_325.png", "blo_326.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LatishaReid2.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/curbside-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Latisha-blog-featured-image.png"]}

A light April breeze washes across the parking lot outside New Craig Memorial Church, where volunteers gather to prep their morning’s work. A handful of clients stake out their places in a line of cars.\nOnce the Capital Area Food Bank’s truck rounds the corner for its fourth delivery of the morning, the Mobile Market in Maryland’s Capitol Heights can officially spring into action.\nClients, as well as volunteers from the Community Ministry of Prince George’s County, visit this spot monthly. Most attendees stocking up on groceries are repeat clients. “We’re like the mailman: here no matter what,” says one volunteer.\nOn this mild morning, roughly 20 to 25 vehicles pass through the market, motoring up to pallets stacked with bags of food. Volunteers load the goods, offered at no cost, into open trunks.\nOn this particular morning, the menu includes mixed-fruit packs, tomato sauce, and elbow pasta, among other items. Produce is a priority, and cabbage and onions are among the offerings.\nThe University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) has invested $200,000 to support Mobile Markets operated by CAFB in Prince George’s County, which has one of the highest food-insecurity rates across the nonprofit’s service region. The food bank’s UMMS-funded markets are providing roughly 350,000 meals across the seven market locations in Bladensburg, Capitol Heights, and Oxon Hill.\nHunger is a key factor contributing to adverse health outcomes. By donating funds and providing volunteer power, UMMS seeks to target social determinants of health and reduce food insecurity — both in the immediate future and in the long run.\nLearn more about the impact of these community distributions by hearing from two Mobile Market attendees.\nVirginia is a true smoothie lover. She provides a verbal sketch of her process, discussing how she works fruit and veggies into her own irresistible blends. It’s only natural that she appreciates the produce at each Mobile Market.\n“It’s amazing,” Virginia says of attending the distribution. “[I’m] grateful for what they give me.”\nIt’s been years since she started coming here: news of the market’s existence initially reached her through word of mouth. Now a recurring client, she expresses appreciation for the flexibility the Mobile Market affords her. As an older woman whose disabled husband now lives in a nursing home, she’s grateful not to need to hit the grocery store as often as before. “I’m so thankful for the food bank,” she says. “I really am.”\nVirginia is focused on making the most of the day’s menu. It’s common for her to freeze food, prolonging its freshness. Sometimes, she’ll whip up a soup. Still, she knows that there will be a surplus among the items she brings home. So she shares the bounty, offering up goods to three to four older neighbors. In her words: “It’s very helpful to help each other.”\nWhat would Virginia tell the individuals who helped supply these groceries? Standing next to her open trunk, she considers this and says, “I’m glad we have someone who cares about other people—to show that there’s kindness.”\nWhile waiting in line, Louise speaks through her rolled-down car window. “It’s a big help,” she says of the market. Her tiny dog and travel companion, Tinkerbell, wriggles and yips, bouncing between the front and back seats.\n“It’s actually food on the table,” adds Louise, who resides in neighboring Montgomery County.\nTo the people helping provide the food, she “would say thank you” and “I appreciate ’em.” She also lauds the “really nice” volunteers who manage the distribution.\nShe acknowledges how many folks are enduring difficult days: “Some people may not get much more” than what they receive through charitable means. Fortunately, visitors receive a substantial amount of food at the Mobile Market. Louise recalls a morning, months ago, when she transported 50 pounds of produce home.\nLouise is someone who likes to share. Whether spreading the word about resources she finds online or dishing out food for stray critters, she prioritizes giving. She mentions the region’s population of disabled seniors and explains how she often grabs food for them to help lighten their loads. That includes delivering groceries to an elderly neighbor who has cancer and survived a COVID-19 infection.\nWhen asked what she’d say to someone nervous to ask for help, Louise responds, “C’mon—I’ll go with you.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_327.png", "blo_328.png", "blo_329.png", "blo_330.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/UMMS-featured-image.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_0348-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PleaseUseThisPic-1-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/UMMS-featured-image.png"]}

The $6 gallon of milk went in her grocery cart, but she may not be able to pick up another at that price until her SNAP benefits reload.\n“I still got it, because the children love it,” Chelsi says, but she had to ask her teenagers: “Can we please try to stretch it out?”\nIt doesn’t just seem like food prices are on the rise.Recent federal dataillustrates the price spikes that are straining the budgets of both the Capital Area Food Bank and the clients we serve.\nThe cost of groceries has jumped 10% in the last year — the largest 12-month increase since the period ending March 1981, according to the U.S. Labor Department. Other necessities also are on the rise, including gasoline, which is up 48% compared to a year ago.\nHigh food prices influence food access and affordability. That’s particularly true for lower-income households, whichspend a higher percentage of their income on necessities like food.\nChelsi, who is part of the Capital Area Food Bank’sClient Leadership Council, says the higher grocery prices have meant seeking out more items that will last through multiple meals. For example, she uses pricier ground beef in a big batch of chili, which can be stretched across several days.\n“I’m buying more so out of necessity than giving them the things they would necessarily want.”— Chelsi Lewis, member of CAFB’s Client Leadership Council\nThose affected most acutely by higher food costs are also those who may still be recovering from the pandemic’s consequences. Across the greater Washington region, food insecurity remains 50% higher than it was before 2020.\nTo meet that still-elevated need, the food bank has been purchasing a larger share of the food to supplement items sourced through donations and government programs. Not only is there a larger amount of food that the food bank is purchasing, but those items also have higher prices.\nProtein is one example of the rising costs: frozen meat prices are up 31% over the past year. Compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic began, the cost of fresh chicken has risen 80% to 100%, and there’s much less availability.\nCanned fruits and vegetables are also becoming more costly. Compared to prices that the food bank paid two years ago, canned fruit is now twice as expensive.\nAnother challenge is getting those food items to our partner organizations and clients at a time when fuel prices also are surging.\nAnecdotally, some partner organizations are seeing an uptick in those seeking assistance. There also are more requests for items that are seeing the greatest increases at the grocery store.\nThe higher prices are a challenge for Chelsi, who has two fast-growing teenagers in her house. The rising costs also force tough decisions that she’d rather her children didn’t have to see.\n“It kindof makes me feel bad, because I never want them to really see what we are goingthrough,” she says.\nChelsi says she is hopeful that the rising costs are temporary. Experts attribute the increases toa mix of factors, from the pandemic-related supply chain shortages to economic ripple effects from international conflicts.\nAmid these latest challenges, CAFB is finding ways to keep meeting the need across our region, together with our partners, supporters, and volunteers.", "image_filenames": ["blo_331.png", "blo_332.png", "blo_333.png"], "image_links": ["https://live.staticflickr.com/8851/17294556256_6fdfd1e4e7_b.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Selfie_Chelsi-and-Senator-Kagan.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/milk.jpg"]}

For most of 2020 and part of 2021, Clarke was working eight volunteer shifts each week, including double shifts on weekends.\n“The need for food was greater than ever, so it felt it was something that needed to be done,” Clarke says.\nVolunteering is something that’s always been a part of Clarke’s life, from helping out at his church, to mentoring kids after school, to working at a food bank while studying abroad in London. During the early days of the pandemic, the food bank was one of the few places he found accepting volunteers, Clarke says.\nThese days, Clarke has scaled back his volunteer work with the food bank slightly. But he still logs an average of four or five volunteer shifts each week.\nThe time he’s spent filling boxes and assisting at food distribution sites has given Clarke a deeper understanding of food insecurity across the DC region. He’s heard the numbers on how many people locally have difficulty accessing enough nutritious food. But “seeing the depth and breadth of all the resources” going to alleviate that need, as well as meeting families who receive food at Community Marketplaces has “put a more human aspect on it,” he says.\nRudy Uberman started coming to the food bank’s distribution center about two or three years, when the retiree waslooking for ways to donate his time. The rise in food insecurity during COVID kept Uberman coming back over and over.\n“I decided this would be a good spot because it covers the whole metropolitan area, which is kind of nice,” Uberman says. “We send food everywhere.”\nThese days, he makes the drive from his home in Kensington, Md., two to three times a week.\nUberman says the scale of the main warehouse operations also have made an impression on him. He describes the rows of metal racks stacked high with food pallets as “really rather remarkable.”\nHis frequent visit are apparent by the staffers coming over to greet him before a recent morning shift. The 70-year-old says he’s also enjoyed getting know the food bank staffers : “You’re welcomed back when you come.”\nAsked what he would tell those thinking about volunteering at the food bank, Clarke says they should be ready to put in some work. But also that they should remember the labor involved isn’t the main point of why they are there.\n“At the end of the day, it’s not really about us,” Clarke says. “It’s about people just providing to those in need.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_334.png", "blo_335.png", "blo_336.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Volunteer-week-3-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Volunteer-Week-Rudy-Uberman-2-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Volunteer-week-4-scaled.jpg"]}

(Also, food is pretty heavy to haul on your bike.)\nTo learn more about how the cycling group raised almost $9,000 — a donation that can provide nearly 18,000 meals — for Capital Area Food Bank in the past two years, we spoke to Rumi about her fundraising experience usingCAFB’s digital fundraising platform.\nWhat is Freezing Saddles and what inspired your group to start an online fundraiser for the Capital Area Food Bank?\nDuring the Freezing Saddles competition, every year about 200 cyclists in the Bike Arlington group are placed on teams and earn “points” for riding their bikes for 78 days of winter fun. Cyclists also compete in additional competitions like daily scavenger hunts, finding every state license plate, funky sock competitions, and more!Many folks said that the Freezing Saddles competition itself, which is free, gives them so much joy, so Feeding Saddles gives them a way to pay it forward and it’s even better that we can do so collectively.\nFor those who haven’t set up an online fundraiser before, what was it like to get started?\nThe Classy platform makes it very easy to set upa team fundraiser, set goals, and track your progress. People really like being able to see who else is donating and how much the whole group has raised. And, of course, Elspeth at the Capital Area Food Bank helped out tremendously this year when I got a little behind on setting up the campaign!\nHow did you inspire at least 50 people to donate two years in a row?\nI made the first donation before appealing to the other participants. I asked team captains to first donate themselves and then ask their team members to donate.  I set a goal of having at least 50 participants chip in any amount and emphasized [meeting that donor goal] over the dollar amount. I posted frequent updates in our various communication channels including our Facebook group, the Bike Arlington Forum, and Strava (the biking app the competition uses to tally points).  The sponsor of another side competition focused on doing good deeds offered bonus points for donating, which was terrific!\nAny funny stories related to the Feeding Saddles Fundraiser?\nSince we cyclists often are stereotyped as “[jerks] in Lycra” — fairly or not— I appealed to participants’ sense of humor by challenging them to show the world we weren’t JUST “[jerks] in Lycra” but also “[jerks] in Lycra…who care.”\nAre you planning on fundraising again for a third year?\nWe hope to make it a yearly tradition!\nPhoto credits: Rodney D.

{"title": "Voices of Advocacy: Beverly Flanagan", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2022/04/08/beverly-flanagan/", "date": "April 8, 2022", "content": "Bycafb•April 8, 2022\nIn 2007, Beverly Flanagan “started coming apart.” After all, that’s when the surgeries started.\nA Silver Spring resident now in her 70s, Beverly survived two separate car accidents around the turn of the millennium. She prattles off medical procedures like she’s checking lines off a grocery list: one total knee, a wrist repair, two back surgeries, work on both shoulders, etc. As a member of the food bank’s Client Leadership Council, Beverly now shares her story as a reminder that hardship can grip anybody—and that anyone who needs help can, and should, ask for it.\n“I had to struggle to continuously work within these periods,” Beverly recalls of the years of mounting health challenges. At the time, she served as a crossing guard under the Montgomery County Police Department. But even with employee health insurance, which helped lower her medical costs, she found herself pressed to make ends meet. Her part-time schedule led to inconsistent income, she scrambled to land the right doctor for her needs, and disability benefits proved complicated to navigate. “You’re being beaten up in so many directions,” she says of the experience.\nWithin this period of physical and financial difficulty, Beverly would start to seek food assistance. She supplemented her monthly visits to her local pantry, Manna Food Center, with occasional goods from Mount Cavalry Baptist Church in Rockville. This wasn’t the first time, however, that a household she lived in could benefit from a food boost.\n***\nWhat does food mean to Beverly? “Health,” she says. “It means that…people should be able to afford feeding themselves and their families.”\nGrowing up “a post-war baby” in Brooklyn, Beverly saw her mother as “magic.” (It’s a view she held through adulthood, too.) Her mom made a habit of showing up for her kids, often piecing together meals with lingering cabinet contents. She also fostered a deep fascination with nutrition. “Children should not be hungry,” Beverly declares. “They should have the best in life—which I did, thanks to a wonderful mom.”\nHer mother was so willing, in fact, to go the extra mile for her children that she even took on a secret job to supplement the household income. Beverly remembers her father, who barred his wife from work, wearing a puzzled expression on Christmas morning when more presents than expected cropped up under the tree. Beverly wouldn’t learn about her mother sneaking out for an early-morning commute until years into the future. Looking back, she “realize[s] how much [her mom] sacrificed.”\nFollowing a stretch at Howard University, Beverly relocated to Maryland and “moved around just to make it in life.” She took on all sorts of jobs, ranging from a manager in the health field and a home care professional to a Sears employee and a Domino’s Pizza delivery driver.\nToday, she lives with her only child, her “very industrious” adult daughter, who has a learning disability. Although her daughter retired due to health complications, she previously worked in a high-school cafeteria—a position Beverly’s mom helped her secure. A deep appreciation for the power of food and health clearly thrums through the family line.\n***\nBy 2011, Beverly’s surgeries were starting to smooth out many of the physical issues she sustained. She pursued counseling and retired from the crossing guard post she’d held for more than two decades. The lead up to this “was brutal because I had to fight to be protected, while living in extreme pain,” she says. But not only did Beverly manage to keep herself from “go[ing] down into disaster,” but she made a point to give back, in spite of her hurt. “I now personally help people in my community by things I learned along the way,” she says.\nIn March 2020, however, Beverly came down with COVID symptoms. “I just did the best I could,” she remembers. “I was determined [and]…wanted to live.” Having enough food in the home to sustain her during quarantine was a gamechanger, demonstrating the difference stored food can make in moments of need. Later trips to charitable spaces helped her save on food costs, equipping her to purchase medication and health supplies for her household. In the end, “I feel very blessed,” she says. “I know what it’s like to have it tough.”\nWhen asked what she would tell a DMV resident about local food access, Beverly recommends seeking out spaces where food items are bundled with other resources. Although food insecurity largely remains clouded by stigma and shame, Beverly makes it clear that asking for help is okay.\n“I would connect and just share that I’ve been there,” she says, explaining how she’d encourage anyone experiencing hunger to “just reach out.”\n***\nBeverly’s niece initially flagged CAFB’s Client Leadership Council for her aunt, sensing she might feel called to anti-hunger advocacy. Beverlywasinterested and applied. Today, through her work with the CLC, she hopes to explore multiple topics that are important to her, like women’s rights, health, and nutrition education.\nA lifelong volunteer, just as her mother raised her to be, Beverly emphasizes the importance of gauging people’s feelings—especially when they’re enduring a tough time. Learning someone else’s story is an opportunity to “feel what they might…feel, like if you were in their shoes,” she says. She describes numerous community-service experiences of her own, ranging from Red Cross assistance in Prince George County to answering hotline calls from victims of sexual violence in the 70s.\nWhen volunteering, “you’re helping a fellow human being,” she says. “You don’t look down on them…[or] talk to them any kind of way.” You demonstrate respect. You give of yourself to help another person steady their footing. Then, maybe they’ll be able to pass that kindness along, sometime down the line.\nOften, the most effective form of outreach involves meeting people where they are. That’s what Beverly means when mentions “the common waterhole” philosophy. Authentic community connections, she argues, can start in spaces people regularly share—such as pharmacies, libraries, and even food pantries like Manna. This mindset is about more than “just handing people food,” she says; it involves “mak[ing] people comfortable” and offering tools to help “pull them up.” For example, pairing food boxes with cooking tips and nutrition education helps people eat deliciously while also prompting self-sufficiency and health.\nAt this common, nourishing spot, Beverly believes more services than just food should be offered. We grow stronger when we merge our resources, reducing logistical friction and fostering smoother pathways to assistance.\n“If we work together,” she says, “everyone in the household can at least eat…in a very healthy way.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_340.png", "blo_341.png", "blo_342.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/BeverlyAndDaughter.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/B5.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/BlogHeader_BeverlyFlanagan.png"]}

Staci Conley was no longer allowed to perform a job she loved.  Two years later, she is still searching for work.\nA 60-year-old resident of Ft. Washington, Md., Conley had been working as an activity coordinator at several assisted-living facilities in March 2020. The dangers of the newly emerging virus meant gathering in common areas was no longer an option. That was particularly true for vulnerable older residents like those at the facilities where Conley worked.\nThat meant Conley was no longer able to carry out her role bringing residents together. She applied for unemployment benefits, which provided some financial support until the emergency benefits ran out in September.\nNow, two years after being forced from her job, Conley has exhausted her savings. To get by, she has relied on assistance from food pantries and a network of friends.\nFor Conley , the food insecurity she encountered after she was no longer able to go to work was new. She describes herself as someone who has always been able to make meals out of whatever she had.\nNow a member ofCAFB’s Client Leadership Council, Conley is searching for a new job. But so far, she’s been unable to find an opportunity that doesn’t require a lengthy, expensive commute.\n“Even though that had been my passion, currently, you know, I’m just seeking a job,” she says of her previous work with seniors. “Whatever avenue [my job search] asks me to go into, I’m just going to do the best that I can. We can’t pick and choose any more like we used to.”\nAs the food bank’s most recentHunger Reporthas highlighted, the economic recovery from the pandemic’s effects has been vastly different when broken down based on race, gender, wage level and other factors.\nEven as the unemployment rate has dropped overall, those changes have been vastly different across racial groups. For Black women like Conley, a declining unemployment rate suddenly increased again in December, rising from 4.9% in November to 6.2%,according to data from the Brookings Institution.\nWhile she drew unemployment benefits, she didn’t qualify for support through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Without those assistance programs available to her, Conley says she was grateful for the food assistance she received through the Capital Area Food Bank and its partner organizations.\n“Anyone can get in those lines and get nutritious meals,” she says.\nWhile Conley was no longer able to keep going to work at the assisted-living facilities, she still spent the last two years caring for others.\nHer daughter is grown and no longer living at home. But she has godchildren who she has helped care for as their parents were juggling working and virtual school.\n“They never missed a meal,” she says. “I just did whatever I had to do to assist.”\nShe also stayed in touch with residents at the assisted-living centers where she used to work even after she stopped receiving a paycheck. Conley would call them on a weekly basis, offering crucial interaction to those most at risk of isolation and depression.\nConley is searching for a new job. But some openings require a lengthy commute that would significantly diminish her earnings given the recent spike in gas prices.\n“I’m just going to burn my money up in gas,” she says.\nAmid her challenges, she remains optimistic, saying she refuses to “sit down and fold.”\n“I’m gonna keep pressing and pressing, and hopefully, things will come to a head when it comes to getting back on track,” she says.", "image_filenames": ["blo_357.png", "blo_358.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GaynellHeadshot-300x300.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/G.-Staci-featured-image-2.png"]}

Today, we’re shining a light on some particularly memorable changemakers who have offered support since March 2020. Just like CAFB’s drivers and operations staff, our community showed up again and again, going above and beyond to curb food insecurity in creative and selfless ways. Thank you, one and all!\nFlexibility is the beating heart of an effective crisis response. The task of serving the greater DMV during the pandemic wouldn’t have been possible without the collaboration of community partners, especially those willing to pivot in the face of unprecedented change. Take @Food For All, for example, whose average count of weekly clients soared from 140 to 3,400 when COVID hit. The nonprofit, which delivers food items grocery style, serves people with limited mobility—including young moms, seniors, and individuals with disabilities. “Never say something you’re doing is too small or insignificant,” said Executive Director Peter Sage. “When your time comes, you can respond and step up.”\nRead more.\n“I hope that all the empathy and compassion…continues.”\nCrystal Chau’s first visit to CAFB marked the start of her volunteering journey. Chau, who calls both DC and NYC home, responded to the COVID crisis by helping pack emergency food boxes for her neighbors. Her support—among others’—provided much-needed relief, especially as supply chains shifted, older volunteers took a step back, and more purchased food than ever poured in for boxing. “It’s so crucial to make sure that we care for each other,” Chau said. “This is what it means to be American: We help each other, we do what we can, and we step up to the plate to do our part.”\nRead more.\nTess Weinreich didn’t foresee her junior year taking on such an unexpected shape. COVID pushed classes online and canceled track practice, but the high schooler decided to make the most of her new normal. She set two goals: to run 200 miles and raise $10,000 for CAFB along the way. Not only did she smash both goals in nine weeks (which would’ve been the timespan of her track season), but she ended up securing three times her donation target.\n“I had an opportunity to contribute to something bigger than myself,” Weinreich said. The funding would help supply roughly 75,000 meals for her neighbors. “It was nice to see how my idea snowballed.”\nRead more.\nA significant spike in need meant more food than ever was moving through our warehouses. It was only a matter of time before space grew tight. But our friends at Marriott extended support at a critical time, offering up multiple months of storage in The Gaylor National Resort & Convention Center for the food bank’s use. The bonus space (40,000 square feet, to be exact) made a huge difference,as did the virtual food drive Marriott organized to help relieve hunger locally.\nElaine Richard of Marriott, and CAFB’s board, penned a blog back in June 2021, reflecting on COVID’s toll on the hospitality industry. As hotel locations shuttered, staffers lost work, and some sought out aid for the first time before, Richard wrote that “supporting [CAFB] became very personal.” Marriott’s response made it clear that hunger relief was a cause they took to heart.\nRead more.", "image_filenames": ["blo_364.png", "blo_365.png", "blo_366.png", "blo_367.png", "blo_368.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FFA.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Chau.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Tess.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IMG_8557_1-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Marriott-1-scaled.jpg"]}

They’d come to reunite with her mother and brother, who had arrived two years earlier.\nThey also came for a better life: “The American dream,” as Zulma puts it.\nBut it was challenging. Her mother, who didn’t speak English, worked two jobs to support the family. And two years after Zulma came to Virginia, when she was 14, she became pregnant.\n“My daughter was born with a life-threatening condition,” she said. To this day, her daughter requires medical care and daily assistance from a health aide.\nSeven years later, at age 23, she became pregnant with her second child while married to her then-husband.\n“That was a really rough situation, because I found this person to be violent,” she said. “To survive, I had to do what I had to do to bring food to the table.”\nEventually, she filed for bankruptcy in order to leave the marriage.\nShe was able to rely on food banks and distributions throughout that process, but as an immigrant, she occasionally felt scared to seek help through those assistance programs. She feared that the authorities would use her reliance on resources against her.\nAnd sometimes the food she received was expired, or the items were foods that she was not used to preparing.\nIn cases like those, she says, “You get happy [that] you get something.” But then on the other hand, she would wonder, “OK, is this gonna make my child sick?’”\nHer personal experiences of navigating social services on behalf of herself and her family, including while experiencing homelessness, prepared Zulma to be an advocate for her community. She’s done so through her past jobs at Northern Virginia Family Service and the Department of Social Service, and in her current role as an attendance officer in her town of Woodbridge, Va. She also has trained for a paralegal certificate, with the goal of better understanding the justice system.\n“Through my whole entire life, I experienced food insecurity,” she explains. “And I have also worked in the community firsthand, with people who also experienced food insecurity themselves.”\nSo when Zulma learned about the Capital Area Food Bank’sClient Leadership Council, she saw it as a chance to fight for change.\n“I could not sit and watch folks in similar situations to mine and my family’s go without the most basic needs,” she said.\nThat resolve is what drove Zulma to set up monthly food distributions at the school where she works, events that are organized in partnership with the food bank.\n“A child who comes to school hungry, you know—he can’t concentrate,” she said. “It affects his social [skills], emotions, his health—it impacts everything.”\nThe training she’s received through the CLC also has helped her respond to intense personal tragedy. Last summer, her son was murdered just a few days after his 17th birthday. Zulma was devastated.\nDuring one of the first CLC advocacy classes, a speaker described the importance of claiming one’s own narrative: turning pain into action, even when it’s difficult to do so.\n“If you don’t speak your story, somebody else is,” she said. Hearing that, she continues, “really empowered me.”\nZulma wants to use her story to urge policymakers to implement programs that they would want to use themselves. Rather than make people jump through hoops and navigate confusing systems, she says she wants them to have easier access to the solutions they need.\n“I want to be a voice for so many children living in poverty,” she said. “One day we will have a better community for our children. If a family needs to be involved with any food banks, we’ll have better programs to aid [them].\n“I think food brings people together,” she said. “It’s like having medicine. It’s like oxygen. It will empower you.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_369.png", "blo_370.png", "blo_371.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Zulma-1-887x1024.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Zulma-2-825x1024.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IMG_25261.jpg"]}

In addition to national figures like Fannie Lou Hamer and John Lewis, we’re celebrating Mildred Brooks, who was a pioneer locally in the field of nutrition.\nBrooksserved on the Capital Area Food Bank’s boardfor many years and was involved in the food bank’s founding, among the many nutrition-centric roles she held during the more than 60 years she lived and worked in DC.\nShe was the first Black president of the D.C. Dietetic Association, and led the DC Mayor’s Commission on Food, Nutrition and Health.  Brooks also was chief dietitian at the DC Village family shelter, special assistant to the director of public welfare and community nutritionist for the Surplus Food Program.\nAt the DC Department of Welfare and the DC Department of Human Services, she became what they called a “home economist,” teaching families in the community the importance of preparing balanced meals. She also helped create the farmers market at RFK Stadium.\nThough Brooks was certainly passionate about nutrition, her interests didn’t end there:She played piano masterfully and she celebrated fashion, often sporting a hat from her vast collection. To some, Brooks was better known as the “Silver Fox,” a nickname she gave herself to celebrate a mane that went gray in her 30s.\nAfter her death in 2011 at age 95, the food banknamed a newtraining space and teaching kitchenat the DC distribution center in her honor.\nBrooks had a great love of cooking and often shared her favorite recipes with community groups throughout DC.

{"title": "Bringing nutritious groceries to the exam room in new partnership with Children’s National Hospital", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2022/02/10/food-pharmacy-pilot-program-childrens-national/", "date": "February 10, 2022", "content": "Bycafb•February 10, 2022\nConversations about nutrition between the dietitians and young patients with diabetes at Children’s National Hospital often have led to the same obstacle: the foods that those patients need to stay healthy just aren’t accessible options for too many families across the region.\nWhile foods like whole grains, fresh produce, and lean proteins will help patients feel full longer and keep their blood sugar in check, they may not be on the shelf at the nearest store.\nOr those items may be so expensive that families on a budget are unable to add them to the cart, especially if they may need to try those several times before a child who is skeptical of unfamiliar foods becomes willing to eat whole-wheat pasta.\nThat conversation is now changing, thanks tothe new food pharmacy pilot programcreated in collaboration between the Capital Area Food Bank and Children’s National Hospital.\nThe food pharmacy program brings groceries from the food bank directly to the hospital’s diabetes clinic. Instead of receiving a list of food pantries where they could seek out nutritious foods, families visiting the clinic who screen positive for food insecurity can take a bag of groceries tailored for their child’s health needs with them as they leave a medical appointment.\nThat one-stop approach makes it easier for families to access foods essential to a child’s overall health. In addition to the groceries, families also receive recipe cards and tips from the dietitians to provide ideas on how to use those foods.\n“We know that good food and good health are deeply interconnected, especially for young people,” said Radha Muthiah, president and CEO of the Capital Area Food Bank. “For children whose families may not always have the resources to get a nutritious meal on the table, all kinds of health challenges can emerge, including diabetes. We’re proud to be partnering with Children’s National on an initiative that will enable brighter futures for kids by making healthy groceries available right at the point of care.”\nAccording to the dietitians who work in the clinic, the initial reaction from families introduced to the program has been overwhelmingly positive.\n“We bring the food out, and they tell us, ‘I was not expecting that much,’” said Bailey Goggin, one of the clinic’s dietitians.\nThe reusable grocery bags for families are filled with roughly 35 pounds of food at each visit. The contents will fluctuate based on the needs of the patient and their family. While the foods are intended to be shared throughout the household, the items are selected to ensure the patients with diabetes are receiving a mix of foods that are aligned with their health needs.\nThat may include grains like rice, spaghetti or oatmeal; proteins like canned salmon, peanut butter and beans; and a range of produce, like butternut squash, broccoli and oranges.\nThose foods are now available to a population of patients who have a high level of food insecurity, according to a needs-assessment survey conducted by the hospital. Two-thirds of the English-speaking patients treated at the diabetes clinic are food insecure, according to dietitians, and that figure doesn’t reflect unmet need among Spanish-speaking patients.\nThe rates of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in children alsohave been rapidly increasing in recent years, partly as a consequence of the epidemic of childhood obesity.\n“Healthy eating is crucial in the treatment and prevention of these conditions, but many of our families lack access to nutritious food,” said Dr. Elizabeth Estrada, director of the Type 2 Diabetes Program at Children’s National Hospital.\nBeyond the nutrition conversation in the clinic, patients also receive nutrition education materials, like recipe cards and information on the food bank’s hotline, where bilingual staffers field questions about specific foods, nutrition and cooking.\nThose resources help to ensure families can use the foods today. For those who may need help getting their groceries home, the food bank also has provided metal carts to aid those leaving the clinic on foot.\nThe groceries not only supplement their current foods with more nutrition, but they also provide a new point of connection for dietitians to have critical conversations about food and healthy eating.\nWith teenagers who may be embarrassed that  their family may not be able to put nutritious foods on the table, or who generally don’t want to talk to a medical provider, the bag of new foods they can take home serves as a conversation starter about what they’d like to eat that evening.\n“That really gets them talking,” said Hadley Stevens, a dietitian at the clinic. “They break down that wall and then it can be a more effective appointment.”\nAs the pilot program ramps up, it is expected to reach up to 120 families each month through the diabetes clinic.\nThe model is intended to serve as a template for similar food-pharmacy programs in other venues, bringing that support and connection to other families seeking to access the nutritious foods needed to stay healthy.\nThe food pharmacy pilot program at Children’s National is made possible through the generous support of the A. James & Alice B. Clark Foundation.", "image_filenames": ["blo_375.png", "blo_376.png", "blo_377.png", "blo_378.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Food-Pharmacy-Newsletter-photo-1024x703.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Food-Pharmacy-e1644500912367-1024x837.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Food-pharmacy-6-1024x768.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/food-pharmacy-blog-3.png"]}

This year, we will be urging federal officials to modernize eligibility standards to better respond to the needs of college students and working adults who do not have dependents.\nAnother policy effort for 2022 involves crafting recommendations to make The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) — a federal program that provides food to states, and in turn, to food banks and pantries for distribution — more streamlined and accessible. States have latitude in how they carry out that federal program, and creating a more uniform set of standards for eligibility and reporting requirements would be beneficial to food banks, non-profit partners like food pantries, and the clients they serve.\nCollectively, these policies would help the people we serve to gain access to the food they need today while also empowering them to build paths out of food insecurity in the long term.\nFrom the federal government to local elected leaders, public officials play a critical role in reducing hunger and poverty at the broadest scale, and we are seeking the support of policymakers to enact changes that will advance these goals.\nFor more on these proposals, downloadan overview of our 2022 policy agendaor check outsummaries of the initiatives proposed by jurisdiction.\nWant real-time policy updates and information about ways to get involved?

{"title": "Community Partner Spotlight: Bread for the City", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2022/02/04/bfc/", "date": "February 4, 2022", "content": "Bycafb•February 4, 2022\nWhen it comes to solving complex issues like hunger, sourcing and distributing meals is only the first step. A core part of our work at the Capital Area Food Bank involves addressing not only food insecurity, but also the root causes of hunger and inequity. To break down barriers to access and connect neighbors to a range of resources, we partner with local organizations and helpbundle social services.\nBut this approach is not unique to the food bank: This model of collaborative community care—of providing more than just today’s meal—is one that’s been embraced fordecadesby one of our largest partners,Bread for the City. In the 1970s, the eponymous coalition of D.C. churches that founded Bread for the City honed in on hunger relief and clothing access. In 1995, that mission expanded when Bread for the City joined forces with another anti-poverty group: the all-volunteer medical team at Zacchaeus Free Clinic.\n\nNearly three decades since the merger, Bread for the City remains committed to anti-poverty action and prioritizesadvocacy.Though its name suggests a primary focus on food, the organization also offers free employment counseling, medical care, legal aid, clothing support, and more. Such services are offered out of their two D.C. facilities, including one in Northwest D.C. and one in Southeast D.C.\nThe latter location, The Michelle Obama Southeast Center for Bread for the City, was renovated in 2020. The result? A 28,000 square-foot facilitythat can serve 20,000 neighbors, complete with a medical clinic (also housing optometry and dental services), fitness room, career center, clothing closet, market-style food pantry, and more.According to CEO George Jones, the new building “exceeded [their] fantasy of what [they] could build.”\n\nWhat’s more, many of the staff and volunteers based out of the Southeast facility grew up in the same community they serve, lending a sense of neighborly spirit to the space and the services offered out of it. Get to know Bread for the City better by meeting three community members—including a volunteer, staff member, and client—who shared their stories during a recent Mobile Market event.\nSurrounded by a fortress of bagged potatoes, Bobby sums up his feelings about volunteering at Bread for the City’s Mobile Market: “I wouldn’t change this for nothin’ in the world.”\nThe 75-year-old D.C. native has a heart for this place and its people, and warmth shines through in his work and demeanor. He makes conversation with neighbors who’ve progressed through the line, eventually pausing at his station to pick up spuds. “I love doing what I’m doing,” he says, adding that he especially enjoys “seeing the expressions on other people’s faces” upon receiving handfuls of fresh food. And when it comes to helping kids? Their joy brings tears to his eyes.\n\nIn the paved lot behind the Southeast Center, upbeat music pumps from a speaker, its rhythms weaving between tables stacked with produce—including mangoes, cabbages, and carrots supplied by the food bank. Bobby first saw the benefit of such community food distribution when visiting his late mother’s home. Finding fresh food there, he asked, “Where’d you get it?” She mentioned Bread for the City, and eventually, he sought out the organization himself. The groceries he received “helped me a lot,” he says.\nPeople passing through the market offer their thanks. “I really see how much community means to this place here,” Bobby says. It’s a big part of the reason why he’s become a Bread for the City regular, transitioning from a community-service volunteer to a staffer within the span of two years. There’s pleasure in “really doing something,” in “mak[ing] a difference”— especially inyour own neighborhood.\n\nBobby acts as a community ambassador of sorts, pointing his uninsured neighbors to Bread for the City’s ownDr. Randi. He encourages them to schedule free dentistry appointments. Above all, he shares love, offering up sustenance andfriendly words topeople visiting the market.\nAt this food-distribution event off Good Hope Road, an estimated 50 to 100 families headed home with cloth bags in tow, stashed with fresh produce.But none of this morning’s work would be possible without the guidance of Keith Lemons, food program supervisor and senior driver for Bread for the City.\nClad in a neon sweatshirt and yellow Crocs decked out with colorful charms, Keith is determined to catch the attention of people passing by. (Dancy songs throbbing in the background also help draw eyes.) He waves to neighbors, asking if they’d like some produce and, if so, encouraging them to drop by.\n\nThis is a community he’s quite familiar with: In fact, he grew up a matter of blocks away from where he stands at the market. After years working as a Metrobus driver, he took a position with Bread for the City, where he could help get good food onto community members’ plates.\nKeith is responsible for acquiring the food, which hands scoop up from the tables behind him. The day’s menu was rounded up with help from the food bank and fellow D.C.-based hunger-relief organization,Dreaming Out Loud. “Food is our main department,” Keith says, mentioning various programs he oversees, liketheFarmers Marketand Grocery Plus (a Bread for the City delivery service, benefitting seniors).\n\nThere’s a focus on bringing in and giving outnutritious food, as well as encouragingpeople to experiment with less-familiar options (Keith lists venison and eggplants as examples) via recipes. But their mission doesn’t end there: “[We] want to be a one-stop shop,” he says, touching on Bread for the City’s aim to link people with helpful, tailored resources.\nCome July, Keith will celebrate his 10thwork anniversary (or “Breadaversary”) with the nonprofit. And what better way is there to celebrate a decade of service than by continuing to nourish your home community?\nOn his way out of the distribution, Gary stops to talk and pose for a photo with Clothing Room Supervisor, Sharlene Blount.A Bread for the City employee for 29 years,Sharlene is active in multiple layers of their work. She and Gary have been in community together for years, and their familiarity shows.\n\nGary, a D.C. native, calls Bread for the City a “good place,” mentioning that he’s been plugged into its community “ever since it started.” He recalls when the Southeast D.C. branch mainly operated from the building right across the street, a stone’s throw from its new spot\nAlthough he usually receives his groceries via delivery, Gary stops by the center in person on this particular Friday, complete with a mask and buttoned-up coat.\nA light-blue cloth bag — donated to Bread for the City by the Department of Education — is slung over his shoulder, encasing a supply of potatoes and cabbage. Gary and Sharlene discuss information about his vaccination card, then she points him to details about a future appointment, already set.\n\nBy the time he takes off down the block, he’s equipped with nutritious food and a key to receiving important medical care. In a world made more challenging by an ever-changing pandemic, food–supply chain shortages, and — now — cold weather, such supports can make a big difference.", "image_filenames": ["blo_381.png", "blo_382.png", "blo_383.png", "blo_384.png", "blo_385.png", "blo_386.png", "blo_387.png", "blo_388.png", "blo_389.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_8619-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_8655-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_8636-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_8640-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_8648-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_8651-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_8642_1-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_8646-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_8614-scaled.jpg"]}

It’s those foundational experiences that inform my patient care today and help me bring a foundational empathy into clinical practice when assisting patients and their families, whether that is directly in the clinical setting or through administrative leadership.\nPrior to going into medicine, I spent time volunteering abroad, and that time was also formative for me. In India, for instance, I saw a different scale of need and abject hunger and poverty than I had ever witnessed before. Perhaps most striking was the juxtaposition of significant poverty living alongside incredible wealth and technological innovation. There were many communities where families had been living for generations on the street. Those things co-existed quite openly and in such a stark contrast to each other. This is similar in many ways to the poverty and wealth exist simultaneously in the United States but are often hidden from view.\nThat experience and many others had a lasting effect on me. Not just seeing the profound need, but also witnessing incredible human vitality, and the will to create joy no matter what the circumstances are. It sowed a real love in me for serving in partnership with others to address significant and complex social problems.\nOver the course of your career as a pediatrician, what have you learned about the connections between food, health, and well-being, especially for young people?\nGood food and nutrition are completely foundational to health and to our body’s ability to function optimally. As pediatricians, we may be one of the medical professions that researches and studies nutrition more than any other because we understand that this is the basis for all human development, beginning for infants in utero and extending all the way through adolescence and young adulthood.\nWhen good nutrition isn’t present, it can cause illness, stunt growth, impact energy and vitality, and cause all kinds of other complications. During my time as a medical student, I’ll never forget the experience of seeing an infant who had a zinc deficiency due to poor nutrition. The child was listless and slipping behind in the normal streams of development, but we were able to work with the family to understand what contributed to this condition and to reach agreement on a collaborative healing nutrition plan and the difference was remarkable. That ill-looking infant who was experiencing significant developmental delays eventually became a vibrant, playful toddler.\nUnitedHealthcare is a critical supporter of CAFB initiatives that include  pilot programming that providesnutritious food for pregnant and post-partum womento agrocery truckthat enables access to affordable, healthy food in areas with limited retail options. Why prioritize these kinds of investments?\nUnitedHealthcare’s core mission is to help people live healthier lives and to make the health care system work better for everyone. We have known for some time that more than 80% of the elements that contribute to overall health — like the availability of food, transportation, housing, and education — don’t happen directly in the health care system. We refer to these as the “social determinants of health,” and making meaningful progress towards addressing them is foundational for us.\nOne of those major determinants is access to good food. Having food available in your neighborhood that’s nutritious, culturally relevant, and appropriate for your unique health needs is incredibly important. So is having access to the resources and information that can help you stretch your budget and learn how to prepare something that might be new to you in a healthy way.\nCreating this access at the size and scale needed by the community has driven our investment in the Capital Area Food Bank and its innovative work. That support is part of a broader $3 million investment in community-based organizations across the greater Washington region made through our Empowering Health grants, which help to serve communities in need, expand access to care, and address disparities in social determinants of health.\n\nWhat are you most inspired by right now?\nIt goes without saying that this has been an incredibly difficult time for many of us individually as well as collectively. What’s kept me inspired in the midst of this is the remarkable amount of innovation that we’ve seen — everything from the monumental advancements in science, including the development of the vaccines providing immunity from COVID-19 to the social resilience that has been demonstrated in the ways groups and communities gathered together to meet the needs of their neighbors and beyond. Community-based organizations have really stepped up in new ways, particularly in the areas that have been the hardest hit, which were often areas that were already experiencing inequities and disparities prior to COVID-19.\nWe’re not out of this pandemic yet, and everyone who is eligible should go get vaccinated! But the amount of energy and vitality that we’ve seen from people who care and who want to make a difference has truly been inspiring.\nWhat’s the guiding principle that you stay focused on?\nI believe every person has human dignity and the innate ability to achieve their highest potential. I also hold a fundamental hope in communities and in people coming together to achieve transformational change. One of the sayings that encapsulates this belief and highlights both our individual and shared roles in this transformation is one from Mother Teresa, “You can do what I cannot do. I can do what you cannot do.

A calm child with her hands tucked into mittens and her head bristling with dark hair, she is about to turn three months old.\nSophia is daughter to Lisbeth, a Silver Springs, MD resident and participant in the food bank’s Healthy Mom, Healthy Baby (HMHB) program. The initiative connects pregnant women and new mothers with various health risks to nutritious food and other beneficial resources. Launched in summer 2021 in partnership with Mary’s Center, a local community-health organization, the program will support 75 Maryland women and their families as part of its pilot run. Lisbeth, herpartner, and the pair’s three children were among the first community members to get involved.\n\nBoth Lisbeth and her partner hold jobs at a local fish-packing warehouse. She feels fortunate the plant didn’t shut down during the COVID-19 pandemic, mentioning that many people she knows were laid off when a wave of closures impacted restaurants. On her doctor’s advice, Lisbeth needed to take time off work to prioritize her health during pregnancy. Her missed wages, however, started to weigh on the family. Lisbeth had never sought food assistance before—in fact, she hadn’t known the resources even existed—but when her OBGYN recommended her participation in HMHB, she seized the opportunity.\nTo Lisbeth and her family, food is the root of everything. The El Salvador native sums it up simply: “Without food, there’s nothing.”\nLike all program participants, Lisbeth is a client of Mary’s Center: the food bank’s main partner in operating HMHB. Mary’s Center’s team of health specialists works closely with participating women throughout their pregnancies. Moms-to-be whose medical histories signal that they are high risk (which can be caused by a variety of health complications, like diabetes and hypertension) are asked questions to screen for food insecurity. Patients who indicate they can’t always access the food they need are offered the choice to join the pilot program.\nUpon opting in, Lisbeth started having groceries dropped off at her home every two weeks—nutritious items provided by the food bank in collaboration with local delivery service HUNGRY. Program boxes and bags include fresh produce, protein, and whole grains, along with recipe cards and nutrition-education resources translated into Spanish.\nFor Lisbeth, the delivery of resources to her doorstep has been critical. Her doctor advised her to avoid strenuous activity (including lifting) and to prioritize rest during her pregnancy. Without a car or family member at home during the day to assist her, picking up food simply wasn’t an option. Neither was lugging heavy food items into the kitchen.\n\nLisbeth also appreciates the kinds of food she receives, identifying fresh fruit—including apples and melons—as a particular favorite. The day she welcomes CAFB and Mary’s Center representatives into her home for a visit, her box of produce is supplemented with a cloth bag stuffed with beans, long-grain brown rice, masa harina (or “dough flour”), and tuna.\nNutrition is carefully considered when theprogram’s foodboxes areassembled.A food bankdieticianensures theHMHBmenualwaysincludescritical nutrients for pregnant mothers: calcium, folate, iron, vitamin D, and more. Across both organizations, team members understand the complex relationships between various medical conditions and resultant nutritional considerations. For example, individualswith gestational diabetesbenefit fromlimiting added sugars and consumingdietshigh in fiberandlean protein,so menus are developed accordingly.\nThe program also seeks to honor cultural traditions and regional preferences through the food it supplies to participants. Building effective menus requires research and an openness to learning and adapting on the part of the food bank. For example, kale—a nutrient-rich leafy green considered ideal for the population at hand—was swapped out for cabbage and broccoli, two items participants identified as more in line with their needs. This kind of learning and fine-tuning is ongoing.\n\nHMHB was created to test the hypothesis that good food, when paired with healthcare access, can help produce better health outcomes. It’s one of several CAFB pilot programs running under a model known as “Food+,” in which food is paired with other services (including health care, education, and/or job training) provided by partners. The goal is to get people the food they need today while also addressing some of food insecurity’s root causes.\nTo measure the efficacy of the HMHB pilot, collaborators at Mary’s Center administer pre- and post-program surveys and collect medical data, including blood-pressure levels and infant birthweights. The intent is to identify effective, tailored food-assistance strategiesthat can be replicated at scale and inform future programs.\nBy breaking down walls standing in the way of food access and supplying adequate building blocks for nutritious meals, the program seeks to boost the health of both motherandbaby. While the program lasts 12 weeks postpartum, its aim is to have an impact that will ripple out into the future by giving infants a healthy start and connecting families to good food, nutrition resources, and additional community supports.\n\nLisbeth wants her family to live well, which means teaching her kids to eat well, too. She says that they have a strong appetite for fruit, but getting her son to eat vegetables has been tougher. “My daughter…eats everything,” says Lisbeth, but her “boy has a little more of an issue with vegetables.” She adds, “I have to wrestle a bit with him so he’ll eat.” Encouraging her family to take in a well-rounded diet has involved experimenting with and preparing the vegetables she receives through the program in different forms. So far, this strategy has helped open up her son’s mind (and taste buds) to new foods. “He was a little bit pickier at a younger age,” she says, but over time, “he’s [become] more open.”\nLisbeth is grateful for the nutritional benefits of the program, but its economic impact is not lost on her, either. “The truth is that [the program] helped us a lot,” she says. Having food available through HMHB meant more of her budget was available for other necessities. By allowing participants to reallocate resources in meaningful ways, programs like HMHB can help alleviate financial stressors, break down barriers separating people from fulfilling their basic needs, and put participants on a path toward healthier futures.\n\nWhen asked what hopes she has for her children, Lisbeth says she wants each of them “togrow on the right path, to be a good person.” She adds that she also wants“to teach them a lot, [and] to always help them.”\nThrough her love and care today—and with a little extra support from the food bank—Lisbeth is helping her children get a strong and healthy start that will nourish those hopes, now and into the future.\nThe Healthy Mom, Healthy Baby pilot program is made possible through the generous support of UnitedHealthcare.\nPhoto Credits: Alyssa Schukar", "image_filenames": ["blo_401.png", "blo_402.png", "blo_403.png", "blo_404.png", "blo_405.png", "blo_406.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211014-CAFBmarys-0335-1-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211014-CAFBmarys-0222-1-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211014-CAFBmarys-0173-2-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211014-CAFBmarys-0030-1-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211014-CAFBmarys-0276-1-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/header_.jpg"]}

Its goal is to create equitable access to nutritious food at affordable prices. As “the food store that comes to you”, Curbside serves residents in areas with few retail grocery options and provides a full market basket of items that include high-quality produce, meat, dairy, and fish, as well as shelf stable foods and personal care items.\n\nCurbside Groceries first began its operations in DC’s Ward 8 in January of 2020. Despite some temporary service interruptions due to the pandemic, Curbside DC has served more than 1,250 customers.\nAfter over a year on the road and lots of learnings, Curbside was ready to expand into Prince George’s County, another area in our region where many residents are without easy access to a retail option that supplies nutritious and affordable food. Before the truck could get out on the road, the food bank worked with Prince George’s County Executive and the City Council to passCB-028-2021, legislation that would allow the mobile grocery truck to operate in the county. After successful passage of the bill, Curbside Groceries in Prince George’s County was on its way to launch.\nOn July 29th, 2021, the food bank marked the initiative’s expansion by gathering with several of the partners who have helped to make Curbside Prince George’s possible at the truck’s first confirmed stop in the county – The Shops at Iverson in Temple Hills.\nEquitable access to food is fundamental to equity and opportunity, and creating that access requires innovation.

Just as importantly, the program provides a deep sense of community that extends beyond its building walls.\nLocated in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington D.C., Jubilee Housing is a community-based organization that strives to create justice by providing deeply affordable housing in thriving and resource-rich communities, and offering on site resources such as after school and summer programs for kids.\nThe food bank provides food for Jubilee’s after school and summer programs, which feeds kids ages 5 to 18. During school year programs, Jubilee provides snacks and dinner, while in the summer, they serve breakfast, lunch, and snacks each day.\nAudrey Walker, Jubilee’s Director of Youth Services, says that the year-round availability of nutritious meals is important for the children they serve. “The meals are really beneficial for our kids. They don’t have to worry when they are going to get their next meal.”\nCarrots, sun butter, and pineapple are crowd favorite snacks with the kids.\nOver this past year, the pandemic prompted shifts in some of Jubilee’s traditional programming and their methods of food distribution, but they have continued to serve meals throughout the pandemic. Jubilee’s meal service allowed their organization to remain both a reliable source of food and center of community as families gathered safely to eat.\n“As front-line workers, we were putting ourselves at risk too,” says Audrey. “But that paid a lot of dividends, creating more trust and a bond with our community.”\nShe adds, “Every time our kids came to get meals, they seemed happy. They didn’t really understand what was going on [in the world] at the moment, but they wanted to come every day.”\nJubilee continues to provide food to families twice per week. Audrey notes that following a spike in food insecurity at the start of the pandemic, the families she works with have had to navigate new resources for assistance, including public schools, food pantries, and other programs. Despite the challenges, it’s been an opportunity for families to help each other in new ways. “Our community is resilient,” Audrey says, noting that she’s seen “families and community come together in an effort to support each other more than ever before.”\nAlthough this year’s Jubilee summer program was a hybrid version of their traditional five-day per week camp, hot meals were still served twice weekly to the kids on site. In the summertime, deliveries arrive the day before, so staff and volunteers can prepare hot breakfast for the kids first thing in the morning when they arrive. During the school year, the food bank delivers food in the late morning to provide meals for the afternoon and evening.\nDespite certain logistical challenges that come with organizing activities, academic lessons, and meals – particularly during the pandemic – Audrey emphasizes how important meals are for the kids to fuel their bodies with the energy they need to continue learning and growing. She also views mealtimes as providing space for kids, staff, volunteers, and community members to smile, laugh, and stay connected when so many people are feeling isolated.\n“People that live in the neighborhood see what we are doing, and they want to be a part of it… they knock on our door and send us emails, asking how they can help kids and families during this time,” Audrey says. “It all goes back to being a community.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_414.png", "blo_415.png", "blo_416.png", "blo_417.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cafb6-e1621356884651.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cafb9-e1621356902208.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/meal1-e1621356917708.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cafb9-e1632175431937.jpg"]}

She’s been passionate about food since she was a little girl, and every day she wakes up and lives by the motto her grandmother taught her: never let anybody go hungry.\n\nMelody is currently the primary caretaker for her mother, who raised her as a single parent. They live together in Capitol Heights, a neighborhood in Prince George’s County, Maryland.\n“I just always try to make sure she has a good quality of life – like she provided for us,” says Melody.\nMelody previously worked as case manager for a community-based organization, helping link people with HIV/AIDS with outpatient treatment programs, food pantries, mental health services, and other resources. Through this work, Melody saw clearly how important it was for her clients to have access to good food in order to maintain and improve all other aspects of their lives.\n“It’s always in me to help somebody,” she adds.\nFor Melody, that means trying to connect people with resources whenever, and however, she can. She keeps non-perishable food in her car to pass out to families she meets, and on her way home from the food pantry she visits,  she keeps an eye out for people who might need food even more.\n“I give to my next-door neighbor,” she says. “I’m a senior citizen too, but she’s older than me.”\n“I grew up at a time in DC when you didn’t lock your doors,” she continues. “If you needed something, the neighbors got together. That’s the era I grew up with.”\nWhen Melody heard about the food bank’s Client Leadership Council, she was excited about the opportunity because she knew she could leverage her background in social services and her love of helping others to drive change in her community. She also had past experience in advocacy, having lobbied on Capitol Hill to improve services for people living with HIV during her time as a case manager within that community.\n“Because of helping people have a better quality of life in my jobs, I thought that I had something to bring to the table,” she says\nNow in the Client Leadership Council, she feels excited about “joining forces” with other members who have similar interests and passions.\nShe knows that looking for resources to put good food on the table can be challenging when people have other important demands on their time, such as taking care of a family or working a stressful job. And that for many, this has gotten even more overwhelming during the pandemic. But she believes everyone should be able to easily access the nutritious food they need to stay healthy.\nWith her passion and experience, Melody says, “I am called to make a difference for humanity.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_418.png", "blo_419.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DSC_4628-683x1024.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DSC_4631-scaled-e1626712512414.jpg"]}

But for kids in our region who don’t have food at home, summer can mean long and hot days without enough to eat.\nOne third of food insecure people in our region are kids. As a result, summers can be particularly challenging for kids that rely on school breakfast and lunch programs. Each year through our summer meals program, we provide the nutritious meals kids need to continue growing and learning – even when school isn’t in session. With significantly more families experiencing food insecurity due to the economic impacts of the pandemic, this summer was no exception. Check out this summer’s meals for kids by the numbers:\nAccess to daily summer meals helps kids feel full and energized, so they can be ready for summer adventures, and spend summer growing, learning, and playing outside. Operating through the USDA’s Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), our Kids Summer Meals Program delivers healthy, kid-friendly meals to apartment buildings, community centers, places of worship, and other locations in neighborhoods in our region where children are at risk of going hungry during the summer. Many of our program sites also offer sports and academic activities, while also providing them with good and healthy food.\nDuring the school year, these kids may have access to free or reduced-price breakfasts and lunches, but those meals go away during the summer. According to data from our2020 Hunger Report, the number of children in our region experiencing food insecurity almost doubled over the past year. The impacts of food insecurity on kids is wide-ranging and can often ripple into adulthood.\nWith proper nutrition during the warm summer months, kids are more likely to remember what they’ve learned during the school year, setting them up for success in the year to come. Over this summer, roughly 6,000 individual kids received meals. This means 88,880 total breakfasts, lunches, suppers and snacks served to kids throughout the summer – more than 44,000 meals per month.\n\nThis year we worked with 45 partner sites across the region to provide meals over the summer. In partnership with recreation centers and many of the same locations that provide after-school meals during the school year, our partner locations offer children a safe place to eat, learn and play.", "image_filenames": ["blo_420.png", "blo_421.png", "blo_422.png", "blo_423.png", "blo_424.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Childrens-Meal-Sites-Blog-1-1024x768.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-2.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-2.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/4-1.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FA_COLOR_DAY_1-31.jpg"]}

Here’s an inside look at a morning at the marketplace:\nBy 7:30 am on Saturday morning, the parking lot on the corner of L Street and New Jersey Avenue is anything but empty. A large food bank truck parks alongside the fence and staff and volunteers unload folding tables, tents, and thousands of pounds of food. Need and anxiety has climbed significantly higher for many during the pandemic, and a handful of community members are already lined up.\nAs 8:00 AM comes around, the food bank staff and marketplace volunteers huddle to divvy up tasks for the rest of the morning. The market serves people from a wide variety of cultures and countries, and several volunteers speak multiple language to help clients navigate the marketplace. Two of these volunteers, CJ and Chin-Lan, head to the line across the parking lot and begin to help people check in. A few volunteers join them to pass out cold water to community members in line.\nThe rest of the group sets up tents and tables and begins to organize and sort the food going out that day. Veteran volunteer Jimmy is the food director, and shows the other volunteers what will be distributed to each person: a produce box (including carrots, cabbage, potatoes, eggplant, romaine lettuce, etc.), and a reusable grocery bag packed with watermelon, several cans of tuna, bottles of water, and cereal.\nPrior to the pandemic, the market operated as what’s known as a “client choice model,” where visitors select their own food and produce as they would in a store or farmer’s market. With health risks now lower in the region, DC’s Community Marketplaces will transition back to this model at future markets.\nAt 9 AM, the marketplace opens and one by one, community members pick up their produce and other food. A heavy box and bag can be a lot to carry alone, so family and friends help each other out, lending a hand to unbox the produce and carry it back home.\nAfter they retrieve their food, community members can stop by informational tables to learn about other programs and resources that can help support them, in addition the monthly marketplaces. Food bank staff set up a table about Grocery Plus (the Commodity Supplemental Food Program), a free food and produce program for seniors living in DC. A representative from the Mayor’s Office on Asian and Pacific Islanders Affairs also joins to share information and resources with community members after they pick up their food.  As the pandemic winds down, the food bank hopes to coordinate even more social services and resources on site, like nutrition experts and cooking demos, to enhance the experience for clients at the market.\nAfter every produce box is handed out, every can of tuna is distributed, and the tents and other items are packed up, the staff and volunteers come together for one last huddle to debrief and total the morning’s numbers.\nOn this particular day, they have served 156 households and 259 individuals, including 16 children and 173 seniors with the food for 6,407 meals – big numbers for just a few hours’ work.\nFollowing a round of “thank yous,” the volunteers get ready to head out. Many are reflective of the day’s work.\n“At any given moment, this could be any one of us,” says one. “And that’s why I am here to give back.”\n\n\nThe DC Community Marketplace is open to all residents in need of food assistance. It is located on L St. NW between New Jersey Ave. NW and First St. NW, Washington, DC 20001.

It reveals dramatic shifts in the face of hunger during the course of the pandemic that could impact our region for years to come.\nBelow is a recap of the report’s key findings, as well as its topline recommendations for ways that every sector can work to create greater economic stability, food security, and opportunity for more people as our region rebuilds.\n\n\n\n\nWell over a year on, COVID-19 has continued to expose and magnify the often-profound inequities that exist in our country and region. During the pandemic, these inequities have contributed to significant negative impacts on the health, economic stability, and food security of people who were already vulnerable. In the longer term, current trends show that they also threaten to drive even more individuals into a new cycle of economic hardship and food insecurity that could last for generations.\nWhile the past fifteen months have presented unprecedented challenges for people across the globe, they have also generated countless examples of what can be accomplished when individuals and communities work together to address them. In a moment when the imperative for change is clear, the potential to create it has also never been greater.\nRead Hunger Report 2021", "image_filenames": ["blo_429.png", "blo_430.png", "blo_431.png", "blo_432.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG-3826-e1624462430311-947x1024.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG-3829-e1624472571150-1024x495.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG-3825-1024x530.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG-3837.jpg"]}

When she was asked to join the board of directors, she  jumped at the opportunity. At the time, she didn’t realize that her purpose in supporting the food bank would change in a matter of weeks as the COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges.\nBy Elaine Richard, Area Vice President, Americas Eastern Region | Full Service Hotels at Marriott International and CAFB Board Member\nThe alarming increase in the number of people impacted by food insecurity is concerning and hits close to home in the communities where Marriott does business. Of course, the issue of food insecurity isn’t unique to America, nor is it solely the result of the pandemic. But prior to 2020 it was at a two-decade low ­ — and then came COVID and the economic decline. We were forced to temporarily close many hotels which resulted in friends, colleagues, and associates being furloughed, along with hundreds of thousands of hospitality professionals across the globe. Reality quickly sunk in that those same friends and colleagues potentially faced food insecurity for the first time in their lives.\nSupporting Capital Area Food Bank became very personal at that moment.\nI’ve learned in my time on the Board that hunger exists in every part of the world, in every country, and within every zip-code in our region. It does not discriminate. Here in the Greater Washington, DC area, the food bank doesn’t just feed people. They employ robust programming to empower their clients by focusing on health, education and skills development that allows them to not just make better decisions with nutrition, but also their long-term financial stability that will pave a path out of poverty and food insecurity.\nThe food bank did an amazing job proactively making changes in their operations to support the surge in demand for food in the region. As demand increased, they needed to secure more food to meet the needs of the community and soon ran out of storage space. The Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center stepped in and offered 40,000 sq ft of unused event space for several months so the food bank could ramp up their services to meet unprecedented need. This hotel is a shining example of Marriott’s sustainability and social impact platform,Serve 360, which puts our core value to “Serve Our World” into action.\nThere is more hope and optimism as we recover from this devastating pandemic, but far too many in our community will remain hungry. Feeding America projects that food insecurity levels are expected to be near historical highs through 2021. To increase our efforts to help put food on the tables of those in need, we’ve launched a campaign in partnership with the Capital Area Food Bank.\nHere’s how you can help.\nFrom June 1stthrough August 31stMarriott hotels in the Greater Washington, DC area will be hosting a digital food donation drive for our friends at the food bank and participating is incredibly easy.\nGuests and the general publiccan access the virtual giving pageand purchase food items that will then be gifted to the food bank and distributed to communities in need. While you can access the donation pagehere, guests will also see promotional and educational information in our participating area hotels. Using the QR code, guests can easily scan using their mobile device and donate immediately.\nAs the DC region recovers it will take support from every sector, even those that have been hard-hit themselves. Just recently during the graduation from the Kitchen Culinary Job Training Program of DC Central – one of the food bank’s largest nonprofit partners – our Chief Global Operations Officer, Erika Alexander, said “It’s around kitchens and dinner tables that we celebrate life’s greatest events, or take solace after hard days and challenges. Food and beverage is a universal experience. Something that all cultures and all generations treasure, it’s an unparalleled way of connecting with community, or just experiencing something new.” I believe that and I want to afford every family and every person that opportunity — and every little bit helps. So, I invite you to join us in supporting this campaign and humbly thank you for your consideration in helping us change the tide on food insecurity, one kitchen table at a time.", "image_filenames": ["blo_433.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hero_Donate_DSC4507.jpg"]}

She believes that empowering families through food access and security is central to improving the lives of families in her community and furthering equity in the D.C. area. As a member of our Client Leadership Council, Shonnie hopes to become a more effective advocate for her family and community.\nShonnie’s journey as an advocate for food access and security is personal. While experiencing some health issues, Shonnie decided to change her lifestyle and become a vegetarian. After incorporating this change into her life, she noticed that most food resource centers such as food pantries and other food distribution sites offering free and hot meals in her area did not offer any dietary accommodations. This realization jump started Shonnie’s advocacy, and she made it her mission to gain as much knowledge as possible about eating and accessing healthy food.\nHer experience as mom to her son with autism who requires special dietary needs, such as gluten-free and casein-free foods, further fueled her passion for access to healthy food.\nShonnie says when she lived in Southeast D.C, “it was and still is a food desert,” and that “the food choices were so unhealthy and scarce that it forced me to travel to Maryland to grocery shop.”\nShe notes that grocery stores in less affluent neighborhoods rarely have a wide variety of food to fit the needs of her son’s diet.\n“Food is important,” she says. “Quality of food is important. Access is more important.”\nShe points to areas around her home city of DC as a prime example where food access is limited.\n“There’s been a food desert in Ward 7 and 8 for as long as I can remember,” she says. “I lived in Ward 8 about 12 years ago, and there was one grocery store.”\n“I live in Ward 1 now, and in a five or six block radius, I can probably pass four grocery stores,” she continues.\nAs someone who grew up in the District, she says, she’s seen the city change over the decades.\n“This is a great city,” she says. But, she continues, “there’s a huge wealth gap. There’s a huge knowledge gap.”\n“Sometimes you have to get people to look outside of the box to understand that opportunity is available,” she adds. “What’s going on today doesn’t have to go on tomorrow.”\nThrough her work with the CLC, Shonnie is honing her advocacy skills to push for initiatives that promote greater entrepreneurship in areas with fewer grocery stores by encouraging the government to create programs that empower people to open their own stores. She believes such a strategy would both create employment opportunities for residents in need of work, and also create access to fresher, more nutritious food. Shonnie also advocates for increasing SNAP benefits (formerly know as food stamps) as an important way to expand consistent access to good food for those who need it.\nShonnie is especially focused on connecting with legislators by speaking to her own experiences. “Writing a letter is great,” she says. “But sometimes you get three minutes to give testimony, and you want to make those three minutes count.”\nShe says she wants to leave a “legacy of positivity” for her two children, and that is why she is such a passionate advocate.\n“I try to teach them as much as possible. I believe I’m their first teacher: about life, about finances, about having respect for yourself. I try to teach them love.”\nShonnie hopes to instill her passion of helping others in her two children because, “Along the way, by helping people, you encourage them to help themselves,” she says. “I can help you get to where you need to be, then you pay it forward and help someone else.”\n“It’s like passing a torch,” she adds.", "image_filenames": ["blo_434.png", "blo_435.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Shonnie-e1621866828951.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hero_Donate_DSC4507.jpg"]}

Her summer is packed full of cohorts of kids and their families. Jubilee’s youth programs provide kids with experiential learning like field trips, practice in science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM), and opportunities for community service and civic engagement. But even more importantly, it provides hot meals and snacks to keep kids healthy and energized throughout the summer and beyond.\nLocated in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington D.C., Jubilee Housing is a community-based organization that strives to create justice by providing deeply affordable housing in thriving and resource-rich communities and offering on site resources such as after school and summer programs for kids.\nThe food bank provides food for Jubilee’s after school and summer programs, which feeds kids ages 5 to 18. During school year programs, Jubilee provides snacks and dinner, while in the summer, they serve breakfast, lunch, and snacks each day.\nAudrey says that the year-round availability of nutritious meals is important for the children they serve. “The meals are really beneficial for our kids. They don’t have to worry when they are going to get their next meal.”\nCarrots, sun butter, and pineapple are crowd favorite snacks with the kids.\nOver this past year, the pandemic prompted shifts in some of Jubilee’s traditional programming and their methods of food distribution, but still, they continued to serve meals throughout the pandemic. Jubilee’s meal service allowed their organization to remain both a reliable source of food and center of community as families gathered safely to eat.\n“As front-line workers, we were putting ourselves at risk too,” says Audrey. “But that paid a lot of dividends, creating more trust and bond with our community.”\nShe adds, “Every time our kids came to get meals, they seemed happy. They didn’t really understand what was going on [in the world] at the moment, but they wanted to come every day.”\nJubilee continues to provide food to families twice per week. Audrey notes that following a spike in food insecurity at the start of the pandemic, the families she works with have had to navigate new resources for assistance, including public schools, food pantries, and other programs. Despite the challenges, it’s been an opportunity for families to help each other in new ways. “Our community is resilient,” Audrey says. She’s seen “families and community come together in an effort to support each other more than ever before.”\nAlthough this year’s Jubilee summer program is a hybrid version of their traditional five-day per week camp, hot meals will still be served twice weekly to the kids on site. During the school year, the food bank delivers food in the late morning to provide meals for the afternoon and evening. In the summertime, deliveries arrive the day before, so staff and volunteers can prepare hot breakfast for the kids first thing in the morning when they arrive.\nDespite certain logistical challenges that come with organizing cohorts of kids for activities, field trips, academic lessons, and meals, Audrey emphasizes how important meals are for the kids and the community to stay connected. Breakfast, lunch, and snacks are opportunities for kids to fuel their bodies with energy to continue learning and growing. These mealtimes also provide space for kids, staff, volunteers, and community members to smile, laugh, and stay connected during busy summer days.\n“People that live in the neighborhood see what we are doing, and they want to be a part of it… they knock on our door and send us emails, asking how they can help kids and families during this time,” Audrey adds.\n“It all goes back to being a community.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_436.png", "blo_437.png", "blo_438.png", "blo_439.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cafb6-e1621356884651.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cafb9-e1621356902208.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/meal1-e1621356917708.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cafb9-1-e1622739699896.jpg"]}

With a simple provision in your will that can be of any size comfortable to you, you join a group of committed supporters who are helping to secure the financial future of the CAFB and ensure that all have access to good food today and brighter futures tomorrow.\n\nAlthough we both know what it feels like to be hungry, it’s never because we don’t have enough to eat. Like many others in our country, our experiences of hunger have been limited to occasions when circumstances have caused us to delay a meal, or even miss one entirely.\nYet, we have always been secure in knowing that food would soon be available, so no experience of our hunger has ever become a sour of pain or suffering in our lives.\nBut what is it like for people in circumstances when food is not so assuredly available?\nAnd worse, what is it like for people when food is never reliably available at all?\nWhen missing a meal is not just some random, sporadic even but instead is a regular and frequent occurrence and part of daily life?\nIn a country as rich as ours, we are saddened that conditions exist where questions like these even require an answer in the first place. But, thankfully, there are institutions across the country dedicated to mitigating these types of conditions that make such questions so morally relevant. The Capital Area Food Bank is one such institution and is a shining light in the effort to make our community and our society more decent and humane.\nThis is why we support it and why we have chosen to include it it in our estate plan.

For example, we’re now being more intentional with how we place the products in the boxes to make sure everything travels nicely and can fit. On one Saturday shift, I helped to pack 1,647 boxes! Normally, we pack 1,000. It felt great to accomplish our record for the most boxes packed in a 3-hour timeframe and to see how many people were going to be helped by our hard work.\nQ.

In addition to the variety of services the church provides, the CCF partners with the food bank to stock their in-house food pantry with fresh produce and staple ingredients. The food bank spoke to Executive Pastor Akeia Rossiter about how the Fellowship adapted to the challenges of the pandemic, kept its doors open, and served more families than ever before.\n“When everything changed, we knew we needed to keep the pantry open,” said Akeia in a recent conversation with the food bank.\nFrom March 2020 to March 2021, the CCF went from feeding 400 families to 5000 families. Most of their guests are families with young children and seniors who come to the Fellowship not only for food, but also for a sense of community.\nWhen the pandemic hit, Akeia’s biggest question was if the pantry would have food to provide given shortages in grocery stores and distributions to supply chains.\nExpressing gratitude for the continued supply of food from the food bank, Akeia says, “We would not be able to do what we do with out the Capital Area Food Bank. We will be open as long as food is provided.”\nLike many of the food bank’s partners, the CCF adapted to the pandemic on-the-go and went through a few transition stages to figure out how exactly they could keep their pantry open. Before the pandemic, their food pantry was set up with a waiting area for guests and a “choice model” pantry that allows visitors to select from several items, similar to a grocery store.\nThey soon converted to a contactless drive through system, and at first, continued allowing guests to choose their food from a menu, but after lines went out to the street and wrapped around the block, they needed to streamline the process through pre-packed bags and boxes.\n“We prioritize basics and staples – things we know that people from all cultures can utilize,” says Akeia. With large West African, Nigerian, and South American communities in their area, the CCF stocks their pantry with culturally appropriate ingredients – like beans, rice, and nuts.\nAkeia describes their growing community as even more diverse than before the pandemic. She sees strength in the community as families help each other out. Often, four our five households come together in one car to get their food or the week.\nDespite the increase in need from their community, volunteer support also soared, growing from 6 volunteers per shift to 25 volunteers per shift at the food pantry. Often, people who use the pantry ask if they can return to volunteer to give back.\n“Sometimes you’re just doing what you know you’re supposed to do, but you don’t know the impact that its making,” says Akeia about the past year. “So many people said the pantry is incredibly helpful, which means a lot.”\n“It’s such a difficult time,” Akeia says, but “through food…it does fill a gap to show people that they are loved, and that people are thinking about them.”\nThe Capital Christian Fellowship is located in Lanham, Maryland. Their food pantry is open from 10am to 2pm on Wednesdays and from 10am to 12pm on Thursdays.\n", "image_filenames": ["blo_446.png", "blo_447.png", "blo_448.png", "blo_449.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_1833-e1617648749710.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_4960-scaled-e1617648911851.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_6231-1-scaled-e1617648597243.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CCF-new-hero.jpg"]}

Our Curbside Groceries truck has set out to help change that by providing a full market basket of goods year-round on a store that’s mobile. DeJuan Mason, manager of the food bank’s new Curbside Groceries initiativeand a 5-year resident of Ward 8, recently took time to share details about how she and her team are bringing new grocery options to her community, and what she loves about the job.\nWritten by DeJuan Mason\n\nWard 8 is a hidden gem. From the grassy knoll behind Our Lady of Perpetual Help that provides an almost-perfect citywide view to the skating plaza at Anacostia Park, the ward is scattered with beautiful spaces. The area community reflects both the self-determination of its founders – who built their own homes brick by brick – and the abundant creativity of its current inhabitants.\nBut Ward 8 is also home to some of the city’s most economically and educationally disadvantaged citizens, many of whom face major challenges with food insecurity and food access.\nIn Ward 8, 30% of families live below the poverty level. The median income level for Black families in the ward is less than $34,000/year, and 17% of the population ages 16 and over is unemployed. Ward 8 also has only one major grocery retailer for the 67,000 people who live there, and for many of those individuals, a trip to the store is arduous. Almost 50% of Ward 8 residents report that they don’t have a car, and in early 2020, the Metrobus system also eliminated or severely reduced many bus routes that serve the area. During the COVID-19 pandemic things have become even more challenging, with bus lines often delayed or canceled, and trains scheduled irregularly.\nBecause transportation is a barrier for so many residents, connecting people with the good food they need requires a new way of thinking about the grocery store.\nEnter Curbside Groceries!\nCurbside Groceries is a mobile grocery store that brings a full market basket of groceries to our neighbors in Ward 8. The truck carries items that include produce, diary, meat, grains, breads, healthy snacks, condiments, and baking goods, and operates year-round.\nCurbside drives into the ward three days a week and sets up shop in the Fort Stanton, Washington Highlands, and Congress Heights communities. Our stops include schools and recreation centers, where kids and parents often buy fruit for snacks after class is done for the day.\nAlthough I’m an introvert, the energy I get from being able to talk to new customers each week – and even running into former students of mine from my days as a teacher – is invigorating! I love to share the history of the truck and its purpose in the community with everyone I meet. It’s especially rewarding to meet new customers and to watch them go from being curious about the truck to being almost as enthusiastic as I am about it.\nCurbside Groceries’ goal is to respond to Ward 8’s need for improved accessibility and variety in food options, at prices that don’t burden the budgets of our customers in need. We also hope that Curbside Groceries will showcase the demand for more fresh and affordable food options in the Ward, and encourage retailers and entrepreneurs to bring more innovative options and grocery formats into the area.\nUltimately, I believe we are all our brothers and sisters’ keepers, and that Curbside Groceries is a crucial and necessary first step in working towards equitable access to food for our community.

{"title": "“When your time comes, you can respond and step up”: Food For All’s Pandemic Story", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2021/03/15/you-never-know-when-your-time-will-come-food-for-alls-pandemic-story/", "date": "March 15, 2021", "content": "Bycafb•March 15, 2021\nFor over 30 years, a local nonprofit and Capital Area Food Bank partner, Food For All has been working to deliver groceries to those in need across the DC region. Like so many food bank partners, they’ve seen the need for emergency food skyrocket in the community over this last year. In just a matter of months, Food For All went from serving 140 people per week to serving over 3,400 people per week.\n“Food is so fundamental and when you don’t have it, it leads to so much distress,” said Food For All’s Executive Director Peter Sage during a recent conversation, noting that he’s never heard such desperation in calls for food delivery and never seen such relief when the food arrives.\nShortly after the pandemic began, Food For All was faced with overwhelming demand for grocery delivery – both among seniors suddenly vulnerable and fearful of leaving their homes and among those newly facing food insecurity – people who had been just scraping by and were suddenly plunged into financial trouble by the faltering economy.\nFood For All operates as a grocery delivery service, providing food to those who lack the mobility to go to the grocery store or to local organizations for food assistance – this primarily includes seniors, single mothers with young children, and those with disabilities. Food for All gets food from the food bank, including our emergency food boxes, food from our menu, and produce boxes from the federal program TEFAP (The Emergency Food Assistance Program, now extended as CFAP – Coronavirus Food Assistance Program). They then distribute food to community partners such as churches and schools and deliver directly to individuals.\nEarly on, Peter admits that logistics were difficult, and demand was overwhelming. But he trusted Food For All’s systems in place as well as the support from the food bank to keep up with rising demand across the region. “We had certain mechanisms in place – we deliver – and we had them in place well,” he said. “Our systems were efficient and our operations were strong; therefore, we had the capacity to explode when the time came.”\nBecause of their existing delivery operations and longstanding partnership with the food bank, Food For All was able to quickly step up and to help by taking on extra distribution responsibilities when many of the food bank’s nonprofit network members had to close due to the health risks of the pandemic. In addition to their own clients, Food For All is now supporting the clients of 16 other nonprofits that are currently not operating due to the pandemic.\nFood For All, in turn, found the food bank to be an important partner as they faced an explosion of need. “The food bank was incredibly responsive to the pandemic, and well, really saved the day,” said Peter.\nWithout this support, he says, “who knows what would have happened.”\nAs a primarily volunteer run organization, Food For All didn’t have any full-time staff members before the start of the pandemic. Fortunately, while the pandemic exacerbated the need for grocery delivery across the DC community, it also promoted a rush of new volunteer and donation-based support for Food For All.\n“We were never short volunteers,” said Peter.\nWhile Food For All is grateful to provide aid to so many new clients, Peter notes that they have faced challenges as the demographics of their clients expand. Food For All now serves over 900 Latinx families across DC – a community they did not serve prior to the pandemic. As a result, the organization is focused on providing culturally appropriate food, like corn flour, to their new clients in addition to making sure they continue to supply enough food overall.\n“When you provide food, people can save that money and pay for rent or medication that is also essential.”\nFood For All now delivers food for an average of 160,000 meals per month. Peter and the organization’s volunteers see first-hand the positive impact of food delivery during the pandemic.\n“Providing food is not only providing emotional support, but also more economic security,” says Peter. “When you provide food, people can save that money and pay for rent or medication that is also essential.”\nHe speaks of the gratitude he feels when he sees instant relief on people’s faces and the bursts of joyful tears when people can feed their families. That’s when he knows they’re making a difference.\n“You never give up,” he says, reflecting on a life lesson from the past year. “And you never say something you’re doing is too small or insignificant. Because when your time comes, you can respond and step up.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_457.png", "blo_458.png", "blo_459.png", "blo_460.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delores-Aldridge.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sacred-Heart-e1615819401552.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FFA-volunteers.png", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sacred-Heart-e1615819401552.jpg"]}

Now, he’s in his last semester at Northern Virginia Community College before he’ll transfer to George Mason University. He’s passionate about ensuring others have access to the same educational opportunities – and have access to enough food to be successful in school. That’s why he’s become a member of the food bank’s Client Leadership Council.\n“It’s like a chain,” says Joussell, now 21. “You become a college graduate, [then] you get a good-paying job.”\n“I’ve seen immigrants work so hard,” Joussell adds. “They don’t get paid as much, but they do it. Having that degree, it’s going to have an effect on the whole family tree.”\nIn school at Northern Virginia Community College, Joussell is a part of the Hispanic Student Union, which celebrates and promotes the many cultures within the Hispanic community. Although many of their events have moved online—including a “show and tell,” where each member has the opportunity to present an item, such as a food or type of music, that represents their country—Joussell is proud of the in-person outreach efforts the group was able to make before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“Every year, for Labor Day, we would set up a place where we serve a meal to people who are going to work,” he says. “We set up a tent and we bring food, and we encourage them—we tell them their kids can go to college, they can attain the American Dream.”\nGiving those workers meals, he says, underscores the sense of comfort and resilience that food can bring.\n“I’ve seen people struggle with access to food,” he says. “There were times when I needed it, and it was something I really struggled with.”\nShortly after Joussell arrived in the United States both of his parents lost their jobs due to illness. “We didn’t have any source of income; I was underage,” he says. “They were getting food with food stamps and trying to make it last.”\nLuckily, his parents recovered after six months. Joussell says that experience made it even more clear to him how crucial food access is for young people – and how important it is to help others.\n“It makes everything easier, having access to food.”\nAs part of the Client Leadership Council, Joussell wants to raise his voice in support of programs like SNAP and help his elected officials see the importance of these programs to families in his community. “These programs are the main source of food for families, and there are families that depend on it,” he said. “The most important thing within a family is to have food on their table…That’s where programs like SNAP play a big role.”\nStudies have shownthat hunger can make it harder for kids to perform well in school, a fact Joussell is well aware of. “I always believed that hungry students will never succeed,” he says.” It makes everything easier, having access to food.”\nHe also hopes to continue advocating for access to education for immigrants. Many states require undocumented immigrants to pay out-of-state college tuition, making existing barriers to education even higher. As someone without legal status himself yet, Joussell knows firsthand how much harder it is to go to college with policies like this in place, and he is working to help change them.\nIn addition to his community leadership, Joussell is passionate about photography and writing. “Writing comes to me very naturally,” he says – mostly poems and stories in Spanish.\nAt home, Joussell’s family usually cooks Nicaraguan food, like the rice and beans dish gallopinto. If he’s eating out, Joussell enjoys Peruvian food, such as the chicken stew estufado de pollo.\nHe looks forward to someday speaking with his younger sister, who’s now 6, about how she can pursue higher education. But his hopes also expand beyond those he holds for her and for himself. He imagines a world where all young people have the resources they need to pursue their dreams.\n“What I want to see,” he says, “is kids having a hope for a better future.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_463.png", "blo_464.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Joussell_Strawberries-scaled.jpeg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Joussell_HERO_2.jpg"]}

Get a Look into an Emergency Food Box", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2021/02/17/whats-inside-get-a-look-into-an-emergency-food-box/", "date": "February 17, 2021", "content": "Bycafb•February 17, 2021\nLast year, the food bank distributed 52 million meals – more than any other time in our history – and demand hasn’t slowed down. The unique challenges of this pandemic have also required that we not only distribute more food, but also that we provide it in new and different ways.\nEnter the emergency food box. Since March of 2020, our wonderful volunteers have helped pack and distribute nearly 350,000 of these boxes, which play an important role as one of many, contactless ways we get food to neighbors in need during this challenging time. Here’s an inside look at how these emergency food boxes come together – and how they get out our doors to those who need them.\n\nEach Emergency Food Box contains enough food to feed a family of 4 for up to 5 days.  Our team of in-house nutritionists works hard to guarantee all boxes packed each week contain food for healthy, nutritionally balanced meals, based on USA nutritional guidelines. Boxes weigh between 19 and 20 pounds. Since most of the food for these boxes is purchased during this time due to supply chain disruptions and a reduction in donated food from retailers, the average cost to create a box is $20.\nA typical box might include:\n\nTeams of volunteers come into the food bank twice a day to help pack boxes around a continuously moving conveyor belt. To ensure that we could pack enough boxes to keep up with demand, our operations staff has boosted packing capacity, sorting food and preparing boxes seven days a week, including extended evening shifts. Our conveyor belt, which is normally used to sort food donations, has been temporarily repurposed and is now crucial to packing these boxes. Our team has perfected the science of the packing line – running non-stop, with efficient speed, and with six feet of space between volunteers for social distancing. Now, dedicated volunteers pack up to 14,000 boxes weekly!\n\nEach day, packed boxes are loaded onto our fleet of trucks and delivered to some of our hundreds of nonprofit partner organizations across the region in DC, Maryland, and Virginia. Previously, many of our partners had pantry style setups to make food available for their clients. Now, during the pandemic, the boxes enable families in to pick up food in safe, contactless distributions from both our longstanding partners, and from new partners we’ve added in the last year to fill in regional service gaps while some partners are temporarily closed.\n\n\nFinally, the food in these boxes arrives on family’s tables, making a big difference in their lives. Gabriel and Constancia Merrill were long accustomed to helping others, but they now find themselves in need. Up until last March, Gabriel and Constancia Merrill had both worked for an organization that brought food to seniors in Washington, D.C. They had never needed food assistance before, but the pandemic caused them to lose their jobs due to curbed operations.  For the Merrills, and so many impacted by the pandemic, receiving emergency food boxes helps them to stretch their available resources and make ends meet each month.\n“We have zero in the bank. We have no resources other than this place,” Gabriel said of a CAFB partner he and Constancia have been coming to since the end of March. “It’s a blessing to come here. It’s our grocery store.”\nProviding food to our community wouldn’t be possible without the dedication of the volunteers and donors who make sure that no box goes unpacked. We’re so grateful for those who are helping us distribute more meals than ever before in our history, and we invite those who want to get involved to visit our website tovolunteerand todonate.", "image_filenames": ["blo_467.png", "blo_468.png", "blo_469.png", "blo_470.png", "blo_471.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emergency-Box_400x300.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Vol-packing_400x300.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Branded-Boxes-1-1-scaled.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gabriel-and-Constancia-scaled-e1613586910395.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2020-04-09-13.05.33-scaled.jpg"]}

And in the case of our oldest friends, they are practically part of the family.  These are the relationships we all hope to have, and over the past 40+ years, it is the type of relationship that the CAFB has been deeply fortunate to share with Giant Food.\nIn honor of Giant’s 85thanniversary on February 6, we are reflecting on just some of the ways they have been – and continue to be– the best kind of friend.\nLike the food bank, Giant touches almost every neighborhood in the greater Washington area. And from the time that the food bank opened our doors in 1980, they have been a rock-solid partner in helping those who call our region home get the food they need to thrive. They are our single largest in-kind food donor, providing substantial amounts of critically needed protein and other food items. And their generous financial contributions have likewise helped to get food onto the tables of countless families. This kind of support tells only one part of the story of their commitment to being a good neighbor, but it is an essential one: over the lifetime of our partnership, they have helped provide close to 40 million meals to kids, parents, and other members of our community – an average of a million meals every year.\nIn addition to food and funds, Giant assists the food bank with a wide range of advice and counsel on everything from inventory management to supply chain logistics. This kind of support adds value in many ways, helping us get food out faster and allowing us to continuously improve service for our clients, while also increasing the efficiency of our operations.\nGiant has invested in the food bank’s capacity and infrastructure many times throughout our history. This was especially true during a capital campaign that enabled us to move to our current headquarters in northeast D.C. a few years ago. Through their support of that project, they played an essential role in helping the food bank expand into our current space, which made it possible to double the amount of food we distribute to our neighbors – now at over 50 million meals annually.\nAs a friend for all seasons, Giant has been a partner through many different circumstances – including some of the most challenging times that the food bank has ever faced. When the federal government shut down in 2018, for instance, and thousands of people were suddenly in need of emergency help, Giant immediately stepped in with additional food donations and places to host pop-up distribution sites. And today, as our region contends with a pandemic that has upended life for people worldwide and pushed 200,000 additional people into hunger in our region, Giant has once again shown up to help, just recently providing support that will enable nearly one million meals to go to families throughout our area.\nGiant has long been the first in line to help the food bank innovate and try new ways of approaching the problem of food insecurity. When we set a goal many years ago to be among the first food banks in the country to reduce junk food in our inventory and improve the wellness criteria for our donated food, Giant was the first retailer to sign on as a partner in achieving those standards. To deepen the impact of that initiative, they worked with the food bank on a recipe card pilot to bring ideas for affordable healthy meals to Giant stores across the region. And today, they are key partners in several of the food bank’s strategic pilots aimed at tackling issues ranging fromequitable access to foodin neighborhoods with limited grocery options, to addressing health concerns and other barriers to wellbeing by pairing food with other services.\nFor these reasons and so many more, Giant is the kind of friend we all want to have. We have been incredibly lucky to have them by our side and look forward to creating even more impact together in the years ahead.", "image_filenames": ["blo_472.png", "blo_473.png", "blo_474.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Giant-and-Partner_embed.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dan-and-volunteer_embed.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Group-shot_Hero-2.jpg"]}
{"title": "CLC Behind the Scenes: Learning from Amy Jo Hutchinson", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2021/01/21/clc-behind-the-scenes-learning-from-amy-jo-hutchinson/", "date": "January 21, 2021", "content": "Bycafb•January 21, 2021\nAs part of the food bank’s Client Leadership Council, members hear from experienced advocates from across the region who have used their perspectives and experiences with food insecurity to raise their voices for change. In January, the Council kicked off 2020 with a special visit from seasoned advocate Amy Jo Hutchinson. Amy Jo has worked for four years with Our Future WV as an economic justice, anti-hunger, and northern regional organizer—a position only strengthened by her direct experience with the stigma and misconceptions that stem from needing food assistance.\nA resident of West Virginia, Amy Jo has been the only parent of her two teenage daughters for 11 years. Last February, she spoke in front of aHouse subcommittee on poverty, where she challenged members of Congress to take a hard look at the ways in which millions of people in the United States are being left behind.\n“Poverty rolls off the back of parents and right onto the shoulders of our kids despite how hard we try,” Amy Jo said at the time.\nAmy Jo recently shared her story with the Client Leadership Council. It’s one that resonated all too well with members who have also weathered the stigma of food insecurity, and at times been forced to make the tough choice between food and other important items.\n“I have two jobs and a Bachelor’s Degree and struggle to make ends meet,” she told them. “The Federal Poverty Guidelines say that I’m not poor, but I cashed in a jar full of change the other day so my daughter could attend a music competition with her school band. I can’t go grocery shopping without a calculator,” she went on.\nThe goal of the Client Leadership Council is not only to empower individuals to serve as effective agents of change in their communities, but to demonstrate the importance of elevating the voices of those who have experienced food insecurity first-hand. Amy Jo reiterated for the group how crucial it is for them to have a seat at the table when it comes to matters of food access and policy: “There’s so much people assume.”\nShe spoke about the common misconceptions of those who haven’t experienced food insecurity. For example, she noted, some believe that people who use food stamps “like to use the benefits on potato chips and pop.”\n“A little bag of oranges will cost you $7 but you can buy ten boxes of hamburger helper for $6,” she points out. When families are working with a limited budget, it makes sense that they would choose the more filling, less expensive option—and food deserts mean that fresh fruits and vegetables aren’t necessarily available anyway.\nThat’s not the only misconception Amy Jo has run into. People who aren’t from West Virginia, she provides as an example, think people in the state “live on the top of some mountain or on top of some holler.”\n“But there’s food access problems no matter where you live,” she says, echoing a sentiment shared by multiple councilmembers who live in areas with few retail grocery options.  “Our public transit system doesn’t run at all on Sundays. You can only take on the bus what you can carry.”\nAs someone who has used SNAP for both herself and her children and often relies on food pantries, Amy Jo points out that food assistance is crucial to connect families with higher-quality ingredients and more choice.\n“Before, we’d gone to this off brand grocery store,” she says. “When I received my food stamp card and got to go back to Kroger, I just remember standing there and I was so completely overwhelmed by the choices.”\nAmy Jo shares a belief held by many of the councilmembers: that economic justice is inextricable from healthcare and food justice—especially when it comes to kids’ developing brains.\n“I’m pushing back against the belief that ‘eh, it’s just food.’,” she says. “Kids can’t learn if their brains aren’t connecting.”\n“We don’t pay enough attention to how food is related to healthcare,” she adds. “Especially with people living in poverty.”\nHer goal is “to paint a different picture of what we assume hunger looks like.”\n“I think it’s our responsibility to frame this in a way that’s not the same old stereotypical lingo and phrases,” she says. “People are hungry.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_475.png", "blo_476.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Amy-Jo_Embed.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Amy-Jo_Embed-1.jpg"]}

Now, she feels driven to keep her community safe and fed. She’s getting started on that work as part of the CAFB’s Client Leadership Council (CLC), a group of like-minded individuals taking part in a ten-month advocacy training program aimed at empowering them to serve as effective agents of change.\n“It took a while for me to be able to tell my story,” Shauna says. Because parts of her life have been painful, talking about them has sometimes been difficult.\nAs someone who’s lived in Washington, D.C. for her whole life, Shauna says it’s striking—and disheartening—to see how the COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the metro area. Shauna and her husband have three small children with special needs, and since the pandemic began it’s been even more challenging to make sure everyone gets enough to eat. Formerly employed in the service industry as a server and a dishwasher, both Shauna and her husband lost their jobs when restaurants were forced to close.\n“People who do things in the service field, they are taking such a hit, especially in the area we live in,” Shauna says. Even without the added stress of the pandemic, she adds, the unpredictable wages often aren’t enough. “We are a service city,” she goes on, “and to not be able to do what you trained to do” is incredibly difficult.\nShauna and her husband are able to use SNAP benefits, but the bureaucracy involved makes everything seem more precarious, and the money isn’t always enough for a family of five. Many times, she toldGood Morning Americain a recent interview, she and her husband might only eat once per day to make sure the children have enough.\n“Thank goodness for the food bank. If it wasn’t for the food bank, there would have been many times when I wouldn’t have been fed,” she says. “At the end of the day, to be able to sustain yourself, you really do need more.”\nHer children get food through CAFB partner Martha’s Table, and Shauna and her husband use Bread for the City, another food bank partner.\nShe appreciates that unlike what she’s seen trying to get government benefits, the pantries require fewer hurdles to get the food her family needs.\n“It’s not as hard to go through a pantry. They take care of you,” she says.\nEven so, she says, she’s faced logistical hurdles in actually making it there. “It’s a little hard for a mom like me,” she says, speaking of the 90-minute trip she must take each way to pick up the food her family needs. “If you live an hour away, even on Metro—it’s hard to be able to pick up the food,” especially on a school day when she needs to consider her kids’ schedules.\nBut, Shauna says, it’s all worth it to help her kids. “I try to teach my children: Be the change you want to see in the world. They see mommy trying, they see it. They don’t understand it yet, but I’m hoping they do when their lives transform.”\n“I try to teach my children: Be the change you want to see in the world…They don’t understand it yet, but I’m hoping they do when their lives transform.”\nThe work she and her councilmembers are doing as part of the CLC is crucial, she says, because in sharing their experiences, they can show those who have never experienced food insecurity how having access to nutritious food can affect someone’s well-being. And, they can show the importance of including the input of those most affected by hardship at the table when it comes to making a difference.\n“I sometimes sit in a room with people who have never experienced homelessness or hunger. They don’t know how it feels,” Shauna says. ““If you don’t go to the people who it impacts, it doesn’t work as well.”\nUsing the skills she learns through her work with the Council, which she calls a “transformative” experience, Shauna hopes to one day start a nonprofit aimed at helping caregivers.\n“Unless you hear from the people that are impacted, then you don’t know how to change it or improve it in terms of how to make a better impact for them,” she says. “I know how it feels to be a server. I know how it feels to have special needs children. I know how it feels to have someone disabled in your house. I’m dealing with a lot of stigma.”\n“I want to make it a little easier for people in my city, because I’m still going through it myself. At some point in time, you may have to be a caregiver,” she says.\nUltimately, she hopes the experience of the pandemic makes people a bit more empathetic toward their neighbors and community members.\n“I’m hoping that when the world does get back to some normalcy,” she says, “then we’ll be better to each other—because we’ve all gone through so much.”\n\n", "image_filenames": ["blo_492.png", "blo_493.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Shauna_embed.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Shauna-header-2.jpg"]}

He also knows how important it is to connect people with the resources they need. And as a member of the Capital Area Food Bank’s 2020 Client Leadership Council – a cohort of like-minded individuals from across our service area taking part in a ten-month advocacy training program – his goal is to use his unique perspective to advocate for more funding to go to resources that serve our society’s most vulnerable.\nJames’ first few years in the service were a struggle — military life, with its structure and regulations, took some getting used to. Born in the District of Columbia, James had joined the Navy after high school and served for 4 years. Stationed in Hawaii during the Gulf War, James says, “I was proud to fight for my Country, and I would do it again. I learned a lot about myself, and a lot about other people.”\nWhen he returned, he says, he faced different challenges.\nAfter the military, James became homeless multiple times. And often, James says, he struggled with not knowing where his next meal was coming from. “I was back and forth, back and forth – living in vacant apartments, eating out of trash cans,” he says. “The last 25 years has been a rough road.”\nEventually, someone connected James with local charities such as Mission of Love, a CAFB nonprofit partner, and American Rescue Workers – organizations that connected him with clothing and got him set up with food and nutrition assistance. And finally, with the help of the Veteran’s Administration, he found a permanent place to stay.\nHis experiences, he says, made it clear to him how much people need food, housing, transportation and other critical services. Now in a stable home, James hopes to advocate for the needs of the homeless and his fellow veterans through his work with the Client Leadership Council. “I think it’s a beautiful thing we’re doing” at the Council, he adds.\n“I think it’s a beautiful thing we’re doing.”\nAs a veteran, James is eligible to receive some benefits through the Veterans Administration. But, he says, there’s more the government could be doing to help those who have served their country.\n“This is a growing problem in America. There are a lot of homeless people all across the country. They don’t know where to turn to,” he adds. “Especially the veterans, who fought for our country. They lose their homes, they lose their jobs, they lose everything.”\nWhile only a small percentage of those the food bank serves are homeless, James points out that homelessness and food insecurity often go hand-in-hand.\n“There need to be more places where these people can go to get help,” he says, and “more social services.” One major action the government could take, he continues, is to increase funding for the SNAP program.\n“An increase in [SNAP] funding would benefit the homeless,” he says. Although he’s gotten a small increase as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, he notes that the amount “doesn’t last.”\nNow 53, James lives in Maryland in group housing. He loves to read, especially science fiction: Douglas Adams and Brian Keene are two of his favorite authors. He’s also in the process of applying for jobs — and although the COVID-19 crisis has made it harder to find work, he says he’s learned that when one door closes, another opens.\n“Homeless people give up too quickly. I wish I could help. If I had a home myself or apartment complex I would let them in. I’d tell them, ‘Don’t give up.’”\nOver twenty percent of households served by the Capital Area Food Bank are home to a veteran of the US military or active service member.", "image_filenames": ["blo_504.png", "blo_505.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/James-LJ-edit1.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/James-LJ-at-CLC-scaled.jpeg"]}
{"title": "Voices of Advocacy: Vanessa Pierre", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2020/10/22/voices-of-advocacy-vanessa-pierre/", "date": "October 22, 2020", "content": "Bycafb•October 22, 2020\nVanessa Pierre has lived in White Oak, a neighborhood in Silver Spring, Maryland, for four years. In that short time, she’s made her mark advocating for access to healthy and affordable food — and the resources to grow it — in her community. She’s among the new members of the CAFB’s Client Leadership Council (CLC), a group of like-minded individuals from across the food bank’s service area taking part in a ten-month advocacy training program aimed at empowering them to serve as effective agents of change in their communities.\nA paralegal by trade for over 12 years, Vanessa had begun running her own business by the time she and her three children — now 12, 10, and 5 — made the move to the D.C. area in 2016. Here, she delved deeply into her true passions: backyard gardening, homesteading, and advocacy around food insecurity.\nVanessa grew up seeing her grandparents in Jamaica grow the food they ate – what she calls “literal farm-to-table”. These early experiences led her to try her own hand at gardening as she got older, and she developed a dedication to and passion for food growing, stemming mostly from a sense of pragmatism: with two of her children so close in age, “it was just cheaper to grow and make things than to buy them,” she says. She liked the science of it, too: that she’d get a bag of beans from the grocery store and plant a few, showing her kids how one would yield 50 or more. “My kids eat vegetables because they grow vegetables,” she says.\nRecalling her own childhood in South Florida, Vanessa considers herself fortunate not to have experienced food insecurity at a young age despite her family’s tight budget. She attributes this to her mother having worked long, hard hours at her job, often at the expense of spending time with the rest of the family. It wasn’t until Vanessa got older and became a mother herself that she understood the sacrifices her mother had made. She found herself working 4 or 5 jobs at times to make ends meet and relied on SNAP (formerly known as food stamps) for a year when she was eligible.\nVanessa says her experience with SNAP made it clear for her that many working families in her area need more assistance. The program often doesn’t provide enough support, she says — particularly when factoring in the lack of affordable grocery stores in the region.\nAlthough she loves living in White Oak, Vanessa also says that simply getting around – to a store or otherwise – is a major issue for anyone without a car. Public transit is “the number-one concern in my community,” she says. When the closest grocery stores are some of the most expensive in the area, she adds, “nutritious fruits and vegetables are no longer an option.”\n“We gotta take back our food, take back our health, take back our life — in that order.”\nShe’s also noticed that some of her neighbors are effectively cut off from culturally appropriate foods, noting her own difficulty finding many of the foods she was brought up with and used to cooking and eating as a Caribbean-American. “You can have everything in the store,” she adds, “but if it’s not something you’re used to in your culture, you can still be food insecure.”\nIn the spring, as the pandemic began to spread throughout the United States, Vanessa testified before the Montgomery County Council on behalf of the establishment of a new farmers market in White Oak. A farmers market, she says, would offer residents the opportunity to take advantage of SNAP benefit match programs.\n“If you’re not gonna give [people] a place to grow their own culturally appropriate food … then give them access to it by bringing farmers markets into the areas, letting them community garden, educating them,” she says. “We gotta take back our food, take back our health, take back our life — in that order.”\nVanessa has continued to serve on the Montgomery County Food Council since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and has assisted her church with food distribution. She also started an Instagram and gardening YouTube channel, Homestead Hustle & Healing, through which she teaches people how to grow their own food even in limited spaces.\n“You can grow anything anywhere,” she says. “I have a watermelon on my trellis right now outside. We can do this under any circumstances! It’s become cool to teach myself and be able to teach other people.”\nFor Vanessa, the pandemic highlighted the ways many people are left behind. “It shined a huge light on all the inadequacies of our food system,” she observes.\nAt the same time, she feels this is a great opportunity for people to invest in themselves and in their communities.\n“Take this time to sow some seeds into your own personal development and you’re gonna come out of this stronger and more resilient,” she says. “If you weren’t scrappy and you weren’t humble, you sure are now.”\nVanessa shares that her guiding philosophy is not to be intimidated by what could be perceived as obstacles. “Just start,” she says. “Start where you are and with what you have.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_506.png", "blo_507.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/VPierre_embed3.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/VPierre_HERO1.jpg"]}

It was amazing to see how friendly and dedicated people remain to making sure that food is distributed especially during these difficult times.\nI was also fascinated at how HUGE the warehouse was. Everything ran efficiently and smoothly. Some people transported items with a forklift, others stored the food, packaged the food, some prepared the food boxes to be transferred to the distribution centers. I was amazed at how much food the Capital Area Food Bank distributes and how passionate their workers are about ending hunger. Despite all that they are giving, it’s incredible that the DMV area is still struggling to feed people.\nI would later get a chance to visit a distribution center in Silver Spring, MD, St. Camillus Catholic Church. Arriving at St. Camillus, there was already a line from the front of the church that extended to the parking lot. I was told that the food distribution would start around 2:30 p.m. but when I arrived around 2:15 p.m., I was surprised to see how many people were in line. Once I was greeted by my contact at the church, Jean, I was informed that people had been in line since about 12 p.m.!\nMy experience was bittersweet, I was shocked at how much food St. Camillus had stored in their pantry and how much they are able to give families weekly. It was heartwarming to see how everything that the Capital Area Food Bank sets up comes to fruition when it’s placed in its partners’ hands. It was sad, though, to wonder what people would do without this type of help.\nIt was clear that hunger does not discriminate. There were multiple ethnicities present. There were some single parents, some with toddlers, some parents with elementary age children. Even some teenagers came. Meanwhile, volunteers helped people check in and carry food to their cars. They were very friendly and helpful. Some people seemed to be relieved to know that they had found a way to get a meal. Other people seemed happy to know that someone cared about them enough to talk to them and smile at them. Watching their interaction with the volunteers and seeing how the food is given to families was truly special to witness.\nAs I drove home, there were still people walking to get in line. I was told that it’s always like this–and that it’s even more so like this because of the pandemic. I couldn’t help but think that some people don’t have food and rely on Capital Area Food Bank to provide it just to eat. I wondered if the rest of society knew this that maybe they would contribute a little bit more.\nThese are thoughts that ran through my mind as I wrote “My Name is Hunger.” The poetry video I created is a combination of some of my experiences and some of the experiences that the world is facing. Something as simple as food can’t be taken for granted. I’m grateful for my experience, and I hope that this poem inspires you to do a little to help.\n\nAaron R is an award winning poet from Hampton, VA currently residing in Arlington, VA.

{"title": "Voices of Advocacy: Odessa Davis", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2020/09/25/voices-of-advocacy-odessa-davis/", "date": "September 25, 2020", "content": "Bycafb•September 25, 2020\nTo amplify the voices of those it serves, the Capital Area Food Bank is convening a Client Leadership Council (CLC). The CLC brings together people with an array of perspectives and experiences from across the region, and seeks to empower members through a ten-month advocacy training program. Each year up to 24 individuals who live in the food bank’s service area will receive professional training through the CLC, enabling them to advocate on behalf of themselves and their communities, and serve as effective agents of change. We spoke with Odessa Davis, one of the CLC’s newest members, to learn what inspires her to raise her voice for change.\nOver the past four years, Odessa Davis has been busier than ever. Between completing school at Montgomery College and raising her 10 year-old son, Odessa had worked up to four jobs at a time to make ends meet, but all of her hard work was worth it to stay on track with her financial goals, which include paying off her car and moving out on her own.\nBefore the pandemic hit, Odessa was working primarily during the school year as a paraeducator for children with special needs. During the summer, she usually works at a camp through a local county recreation department teaching cooking classes, exercise courses, and more. And through her side business specializing in soul food, she pursues her passion in culinary arts, which she studied in Miami before returning to Maryland to raise her son.\nOver the years, Odessa has witnessed how hard it could be for her and others in her community to get the food they need, even when working multiple jobs. “That’s what got me into advocacy in the first place,” she says. And her background in culinary arts made her even more interested in advocating about food issues. In 2019, she testified at a Montgomery County budget hearing on behalf of those like herself, who may be gainfully employed but without a steady and guaranteed paycheck.\n“I’ll always find a way to eat,” she adds. “But other people who don’t have the support system I do, they’re struggling.”\n“I know a lot of people in the school system that work multiple jobs, especially supporting staff like me,” Odessa said. As a paraeducator, she provides instructional and emotional support to special needs students to assist the teacher. Though the roles and responsibilities of paraeducators are critical, Odessa says it is not always easy for those who do this work to get the help they need. “People don’t realize that, in the summer, we don’t get paid at all, and in the winter we only get paid for three holidays rather than the school’s full holiday break,” she adds. “When I apply for benefits like SNAP and they look at my pay stub, they think I make too much. But that might be my first check in three weeks.”\nWhen the impacts of the COVID pandemic closed camps for the summer, affecting Odessa’s plans for work, she found herself at the edge of a common effect known as the “benefits cliff” or “the cliff effect”. The cliff effect refers to the sudden and often unexpected decrease in public benefits that can occur with a small increase in earnings. When income increases, families sometimes find that they make too much to qualify for economic supports—even though the need is still there.\n“I’ll always find a way to eat. But other people who don’t have the support system I do, they’re struggling.”\nLuckily, since Odessa’s son was part of the free and reduced lunch program at this school, her family was still able to receive support from the Pandemic EBT program, which provided money for her son to eat through the summer and prevented the pandemic’s impacts from derailing Odessa’s financial plans. “When that card came in, I was able to make my payments on time and that was great,” she added. “We made it stretch, along with the money I had saved.”\nAs a food enthusiast, educator, and single mother to a growing boy, Odessa knows that having access to nutritious food is crucial to the health of her family and community in both the short- and long-term.“It’s very important because, as African Americans, we have increased risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other issues,” she pointed out. “To reduce the risk you have to eat healthy, and it’s kind of hard when you can’t afford it.So you have to go with the cheapest stuff, and the cheapest stuff is not always the best.”\nNow that school is back in session and she’s been able to return to work, Odessa is looking forward to taking part in the CLC to continue her advocacy work and grow her strengths in advocating for those like her who might “fall through the cracks”.\n“With the pandemic, a lot of people aren’t working,” she adds. “So I like to help as best I can.”\nThe food bank’s 2020 CLC class kicks off on October 6th. The food bank will attentively listen to the collective recommendations of CLC members like Odessa to modify, revise, or create programming and policy priorities that will directly benefit and improve how the food bank understands and serves our region’s families, communities, and interests.", "image_filenames": ["blo_510.png", "blo_511.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Odessa_2_400x300.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Odessa_HERO3.jpg"]}

But in March of this year, the first disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact the community.\nInitially, volunteers served 500 lunches. Then: 1,000.\nBy August, the St Stephen team under outreach director Elder Gwendolyn Gantt was serving 3,000 lunches and 3,000 snacks to families every Tuesday. And the numbers keep growing.\n“Our distribution starts at 11, but people start lining up in their cars at 7 a.m.,” says Robin Reis, Food Distributor Coordinator at St Stephen. They often don’t stop distributing food until 3 p.m. or later.\nEach week, a team of more than 100 volunteers arrives at St Stephen to help distribute food to the community, with about eight people in charge of the children’s meals station. Robin points to the team of volunteers — who are willing to come out in “rain, snow, sleet, 100-degree weather” — as playing a vital role in the program.\nSabrina Scott, also a St Stephen trustee, is one of them. Sabrina and Robin say that the community St Stephen serves is in a food desert, meaning access to affordable, healthy food options is limited. “Our site is unique in the way that we serve the community,” adds Robin. “It’s hard for people to understand until they actually see it.”\n“There’s so much to be thankful for: to be able to serve and see the impact meals are making for families,” Robin said.\n“It’s a good feeling to give to more children so they can have lunch for at least a few days,” says Sabrina.\nAs summer turns to fall, the team at St Stephens is glad to continue its work keeping the community’s children and families fed. “We see some of the same families week to week,” says Sabrina. “They know us, and we’ve come to know them.”\n“We have a lot of people who have not returned to work. Unemployment has run out,” Robin adds. “It’s a humbling experience. And it’s fulfilling to know we’re a little piece of making sure children have enough food to eat.”\nAccording to Robin and Sabrina, the distribution is part of their faith; they say their bishop, Lanier C. Twyman , tells them, “What we do for these people Jesus would do as well.”\n“We all have our ‘aha’ moments, where we see that it’s all worth it. It’s worth the aches, it’s worth the exhaustion,” she says.\nFor her, the “aha” moment came when she was distributing meals one day “and a mother just burst into tears,” she says. Until that moment, Robin adds, “she didn’t know where her next meal was coming from for her children.”\nFor Sabrina, the moment came when she handed lunch to a family with five kids in the car: “I handed it to the kids and one little girl started smiling, and she just ripped it open and started eating it,” she says. “I thought, ‘This is why I do this.”\nThe USDA’srecent extension of nationwide waiversfor the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), through which the children’s meal site at St Stephen receives funding, allows summer meal program operators to continue serving free meals to children into the fall months.  This extension will allow children in the St Stephen community and surrounding area to have access to free and healthy meals through at least the end of 2020.", "image_filenames": ["blo_513.png", "blo_514.png", "blo_515.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_1737-scaled.jpeg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/StStephens400x300.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_1737-1-scaled.jpeg"]}

As a sprinter, she had just completed a promising winter track season and was looking forward to welcoming the spring season’s warm days and sunny meets with friends.\nWhen everything ground to a halt, Tess was upset but kept her focus, continuing to run every day with a friend.  As the effects of the pandemic began to affect her neighbors in much harsher ways, she thought of walkathons and other fundraisers she had heard of or participated in previously.\n“I realized I had an opportunity to contribute to something bigger than myself.”\nShe got to work rallying her community to support her idea: she pledged to run 200 miles and, in exchange, her friends and family would help her raise $10,000 for the Capital Area Food Bank to provide meals to those in need. It was her first time spearheading a fundraiser like this, but she was inspired by her past experiences volunteering with her school at the food bank and with food bank partners such as Food and Friends and Martha’s Table. During her time volunteering at the food bank, she was able to tour the warehouse, participate inFace Hunger workshops, and pack food for distribution. “I’ve been able to do it a few times now and each time it’s eye opening,” she added of her experience.\nTo hit her goal, Tess would run 3 and a half miles on weekdays – often squeezing the runs in between Zoom calls for school – and run longer distances on the weekends. It was hard work, but her community of supporters was there each step of the way. “I couldn’t have done it without friends and everyone who donated,” she added. “There would be friends who couldn’t necessarily donate, but who would help by motivating me to run even when I didn’t want to.”\nTess hit her 200-mile and $10,000 fundraising goal in just 9 weeks – what would have been the length of her spring track season. Two family friends, impressed with and inspired by her commitment, were able to match the money she raised to bring her total contribution to $30,000!\nHer community expressed pride in the teen’s efforts to give back. “Tess’s personal initiative is inspiring,” added ACE Everett, Director of K-12 Service Learning at The Potomac School. “She’s channeled her talent and interest in running track to support growing community needs during the pandemic. We’re so proud of her effort and grateful that she’s providing such an amazing donation to one of our school’s long standing partners.”\nNow, Tess is looking forward to enjoying her upcoming senior year and to attending college next fall, where she hopes to continue being involved in service to her community.\n“It was nice to see how my idea snowballed,” she said. “Not everyone is in a position where their community can support this kind of fundraiser.

He says he had been intending to find his “volunteer home” in this region since he and his wife moved here 8 years ago to be closer to family, but between running a consultancy, teaching as an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, and frequently traveling as a guest lecturer, he hadn’t yet found the time to explore opportunities in the area.\nBut then the pandemic arrived in the region, and the economic hardship it brought caused regional numbers of those experiencing food insecurity to skyrocket, even as the food bank’s volunteer numbers declined. Rob wasted no time jumping into gear at the food bank, and says he felt a quick sense of connection. “I like the people, the mission, the facility. The staff are terrific, and I like the people that I get to work alongside,” he says.\n“When I got home from volunteering the first time, I said to my wife: ‘This is it!’ This just feels like home.”\nWhile Rob had never volunteered in a food bank before, hunger is an issue that he holds close to his heart. He shared stories of his grandfather, who was once a grocer during the Great Depression. “He allowed people to get food even though he knew they’d never be able to pay for it later,” Rob tells us. “So I guess you could say that wanting to make sure no one goes hungry is in my DNA.”\nRob says the desire to focus on relationships and community is one of the positive upsides of challenging times.  “I was working for American Airlines on 9/11, when two of our airplanes were used as weapons. In the months after 9/11, and after many large crises, people focus on friends and family, and on re-connecting. I’ve been doing that with lots of people.”\nNow, he’s committed to volunteering at least once per week at the CAFB, and he also wants to get out and work at its neighborhood food distributions when it’s finally safe to do so, noting that he can’t wait to help people directly.\n“One of my philosophies of volunteering,” he says, “is that we always get more than we give.”\nTo get involved with volunteering at the CAFB, view the volunteer schedule and sign up for a shift atvolunteer.capitalareafoodbank.org.\n", "image_filenames": ["blo_520.png", "blo_521.png", "blo_522.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rob2a.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rob3.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rob_HERO-e1593015903442.jpg"]}

Manned by a small number of CAFB staff and volunteers,the Hunger Lifeline connects individuals to local pantries and other organizationsthat can assist with emergency food help. Since COVID-19 began to fundamentally shift the world around us, the number of calls coming through this line have more than tripled – and show no signs of slowing down.\nUnemployment has continued to rise across our region: more than 424,000 unemployment claims have been filed since mid-March. This brings with it the risk of increased poverty and food insecurity, and the food bank is responding with coordinated innovation and creativity to meet growing demand. In addition to distributing food to the 50% of our partner network that is currently open, the food bank is now distributing food with the help of new partners, such as local governments, to address need in communities that are underserved during the pandemic. We will continue to expand the number of new partnerships over the coming year to strengthen and grow our distribution network.\nTo accommodate additional partnerships and distributions, the food bank is bringing in a record number of truckloads of food to meet existing and new needs. The extra step of boxing this food requires the hard work and dedication of our volunteers. Sometimes packing up to 2,000 boxes per day, thousands of CAFB volunteers have worked together to pack just under 50,000 emergency boxes so far – each containing enough food to provide a family of four with the food they need for up to 5 days. If you want to get involved, view the schedule and sign up for a shift atvolunteer.capitalareafoodbank.org.\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, the food bank began operating 9 Children’s Meal Sites in DC and Prince George’s County and served approximately 3,000 meals in its first full week. The food bank has now partnered with 17 sites, including additional sites in Northern Virginia, to serve more than 8,500 meals per week. As summer approaches and the formal school year draws to a close, the CAFB is planning to expand to more sites to ensure children in our communities have access to the food they need to grow and thrive.\nFood systems experts report that food banks are stretched to their limits in every city across the United States.

Manned by a small number of CAFB staff and volunteers, the Hunger Lifeline connects individuals to local pantries and other organizations that can assist with emergency food help. Since COVID-19 began to fundamentally shift the world around us, the phones have been ringing almost non-stop.We spoke to Denise Yates, one of the CAFB’s main Hunger Lifeline operators, to get an #InsideLook at how things have changed.\nDenise has been helping to staff the food bank’s Hunger Lifeline since December 2019. The food bank needed an extra ear on the phone line during the holidays, and she connected to the opportunity through the National Caucus & Center on Black Aging. She was happy to find herself in the role where she could help assist those who were struggling, but she had no idea at that time just how crucial her role would be.\nNow, calls have more than tripled since the pandemic began. They especially pick up towards the end of the month, when paychecks have been spent or SNAP benefits have been exhausted. Denise reports that more seniors are finding themselves unable to leave home, so they call the food bank in search of partners that can deliver food directly to them. Many are unable to cook for themselves and require pre-prepared food that can be tailored to their health concerns. More individuals are also reaching out from Spanish-speaking communities, having trouble connecting to the resources they need.\nBut no matter who calls, they are connected through the Hunger Lifeline to CAFB partners such as Food for All and Martha’s Table, who can accommodate the caller’s specific needs. “Most of the time when they hang the phone up, they’re in a better place than when they called,” Denise adds.\n“I tell them, ‘Baby, I got your back. I’m not going to let you go hungry. Things will get better.’”\nLayoffs, school cancellations, and other disruptions have led many to reach out to the Hunger Lifeline who have never had to ask for assistance before. They are unsure where to turn, and in many cases embarrassed to find themselves in need of help. But Denise works hard to ensure that those she speaks to feel no shame in getting the food they need. “I tell them, don’t ever feel bad or be too proud to call and say I need help. The worst thing to do is to not ask for help.”\nSometimes the calls are hard. Denise received one recently from a woman who had lost her job at a hotel and said she didn’t know how to answer her two children when they asked if they would eat that night. Fortunately, she was able to help her find assistance.\nMost often, callers give Denise their address and she uses the food bank’s interactive partner map to find a partner or school open within a couple miles of where they live. In some cases, when no partner is available, she goes the extra mile to contact a neighborhood commissioner or other local official to let them know someone is in need. “My job is to make sure they get fed,” she says.\nThe food bank anticipates that increased food insecurity and need for assistance will persist for at least the next year, as our communities and the economy adjust to a new normal.

For the food bank, things have changed rapidly and significantly.\nThough many partners have needed to suspend service, the CAFB has adapted its model to distribute both to its 200 network partners that are currently open, as well as to 20 Community Hubs that have committed to staying open alongside the food bank and at pop-up pantries on an as-needed basis. So far, the food bank has purchased over 100 truckloads of food – almost triple what we would ordinarily purchase in a normal year – to help keep food flowing to our partners who are seeinganywhere from a 30-400% increasein those coming through their doors.\n“Before this crisis, we were seeing approximately 300-400 families a week. Now, it is more like 1,200 families weekly. The demand from our community is palpable,” – St. Stephen’s Church in Camp Spring, MD.\nWe’re continuing to serve children each week at 16 children’s meal sites across the region. The hot meal normally eaten on site has been replaced with a “to-go” meal that children can pick up and eat at home. Just last week, 6,000 meals went out to kids at program sites.\nIn partnership with Martha’s Table, the food bank also continues to support Joyful Food Markets at four school meal sites. Four days per week, 650 students and families at these markets take home ten-pound bags of healthy and nutritious produce to help supplement their meals during this crucial time.\nThe CAFB provides critical nutrition to more than 10,000 seniors across the region through its Grocery Plus, My Groceries to Go, and Senior Brown Bag programs. We’re maintaining our deliveries to senior centers and have also launched pilot programs with local partners to offer deliveries directly to seniors’ homes. TheTaxi Senior Food Delivery Program, launched in partnership with DC Health and the DC Department of For-Hire Vehicles will serve an estimated 1,000 seniors through May!\nSince the beginning of COVID-19 disruptions, more than 1,500 volunteers have stepped up the plate to help us pack 10,000 25-lb emergency boxes of shelf-stable food. Thanks to their help, thousands of families across the region have received these boxes that contain the items needed to feed a family of four for up to five days.\nIn the coming weeks, volunteers will continue to help us pack more than 20,000 emergency boxes to support growing need in our communities.", "image_filenames": ["blo_531.png", "blo_532.png", "blo_533.png", "blo_534.png", "blo_535.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GrowingDemand_400x300.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Children_400x300_opt1.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Taxi-Program_400x300.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Volunteers_400x300_3.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Header_v3.jpg"]}

However, this #VolunteerAppreciationWeek is a special one as our amazing and dedicated volunteers have stepped up selflessly to ensure that their neighbors don’t go hungry during the current pandemic. Since the beginning of COVID-19 disruptions, more than 1,500 volunteers have stepped through the doors of the food bank to pack emergency boxes for thousands of families across the region who are struggling as a result of this crisis.\n\n“It’s so crucial to make sure that we care for each other. This is what it means to be American. We help each other, we do what we can, and we step up to the plate to do our part.”\nCrystal Chau usually splits her time between where she lives in New York City and spending time with her partner in DC. After she decided to spend this time here in the region, she began looking for ways to help. After finding opportunities at the CAFB, she’s already signed up for  several shifts packing emergency boxes. This is Crystal’s first experience with volunteering, but it definitely won’t be her last.\n“This is my first experience with volunteering, but it’s changed my mindset,” she added. “It’s inspiring. You go in and everyone is trying to make a difference. It’s showed me that we don’t appreciate enough the people on the front lines, the essential workers like the grocery store workers. I hope that all the empathy and compassion that people are having now continues.”\n\n“Having a direct hand in getting food to people in need is hugely important, and it is gratifying to have a touch in that process. Because I’m local, I wanted to have a local area impact.”\nAlexander Lofft and his wife have been CAFB donors for more than a decade. When COVID-19 disruptions began and his business in commercial real estate slowed down, he wanted to do something in addition to their financial contribution. So far, he has signed up for several shifts making boxes for families and seniors, as well as sorting food. Alexander is proud to say that he’s now become a “manual pallet jack expert” and has enjoyed seeing first-hand how the CAFB supplies food for so many smaller organizations.\n“I have seen the food bank grow over time; it’s been impressive to watch,” he added. “I have found the experience behind the scenes personally rewarding, eye opening, and gratifying.  It makes want to support more now than ever.”\n\n“I know that this is a very difficult and unknown time for many. I want to be able to help as many people as possible who may not have the opportunity to continue to work, who may have fallen on hard times, or who may just need the resources of the food bank.”\nCourtney Thornton has lived in the area since 2013, and she is no stranger to volunteering. She’s volunteered with the CAFB in the past, and has also volunteered with the Maryland Food Bank and CAFB partner Martha’s Table. She was inspired to continue volunteering at this time, knowing that many people were experiencing job disruptions and would need additional help and resources to provide for themselves and their families. When the pandemic finally passes, she’s looking forward to spending time with friends and family far and wide – but she’ll also continue to lend her time to help her neighbors in need.\n“I will definitely continue to volunteer with the food bank,” she added. “I was volunteering before, but the mission is so critical and I believe the impact is great.”\nTo join these amazing volunteers and the many others like them who are helping get good food to their neighbors during this difficult time and beyond, sign up atvolunteer.capitalareafoodbank.org.", "image_filenames": ["blo_536.png", "blo_537.png", "blo_538.png", "blo_539.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CrystalChau_Embed.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alexander-Lofft_Embed.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Coutney-Thornton_Embed.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Header_v4.jpg"]}

{"title": "Investing in Brighter Futures for Women and Girls", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2020/03/08/investing-in-brighter-futures-for-women-and-girls/", "date": "March 8, 2020", "content": "ByRadha Muthiah•March 8, 2020\nAs a girl, I remember visiting my grandmother in India. At the end of a meal she would offer food to the women who worked in her home, knowing most of them had very limited economic means. She also knew that the food that went home would almost always go to their husbands and children first, and that they would eat last. So my grandmother always insisted they eat before they left for the day.\nLater, as a grown up working in international development across several countries, I saw these same patterns over and over. I heard stories from women of saving a tiny wedge of a candle so a daughter could finish her homework while the men and boys in the village watched a movie on the communal television. Or of saving up some food in the folds of her outfits to provide to her children later, even if she hadn’t eaten that day. Women consistently had less and sacrificed more.\nNow, working back in the US, the scenes are different but the themes are too often the same.\nNearly 15 million family households in the United States are headed by women. For a variety of reasons, including a persistent wage gap between the genders, about 26 percent of those families, or 3.9 million family households, have incomes that fall below the poverty level.\nHunger, too, disproportionately impacts these households. More than a third (35.5%) of single parent families in this country that are headed by women are food insecure, meaning they don’t always know where their next meal will come from. In comparison, the rate of food insecurity in single parent households headed by a man is 21.7%.\nHere in our nation’s capital region, I’ve met and spoken with women who are facing hurdles and making sacrifices as significant as any I’ve witness abroad. Mothers who work two and three jobs to keep the household afloat, who skip meals to make sure their children have enough to eat. And senior women, who make up nearly 70% of those served by our supplemental grocery programs for older adults, who continue to make difficult trade-offs between food and other necessities like medicine.\nWhenever I talk with some of the smart, boisterous girls who participate in our children’s meal programs, I consistently ask myself: what can we do to ensure they experience different paths than some of their mothers and grandmothers?\nProviding good food today to help women, girls, and all in our community stay healthy and strong is and will continue to be an essential part of that answer. The food bank is committed to supporting the well-being of all of our neighbors by providing 32 million meals each year. Several of our 450+ nonprofit partners also offer services specifically for women, including childcare services, shelter from domestic abuse, transitional housing, and health care. Because these partners receive food from the food bank, they can direct more resources towards these programs.\nAdditionally, we’re thinking about new models for addressing hunger’s root causes by working in partnership with new kinds of organizations to pair food with skill development, education, and health care. Some of these new approaches are being developed with a primary focus on women, including new pilot programming that pairs groceries with pre- and post-natal care.\nThere is enormous upside potential for communities when we invest in women.  Numerous studies have shown that when women have access to the resources they need to thrive, they re-invest – up to 90% of their earnings – in the well-being of their families and those around them.\nWhile women across the globe may dress differently, speak different languages, and have different customs, our hopes and desires for a life of dignity, respect, health, and equal opportunity for ourselves, our families, and our communities are the same everywhere.\nAnd nowhere is that more true in our region, where the potential of our thousands of women and girls is just waiting, with the help of good food and the right support, to be unlocked.", "image_filenames": ["blo_547.png", "blo_548.png", "blo_549.png", "blo_550.png", "blo_551.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Embed_womenshopping.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Embed_womanandbaby.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Embed_servingpie.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Radha2019Blog_Embed2.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Header_option1.jpg"]}

She led lessons and developed individualized learning plans to assist each student. After school, she poured her time into her family and to the many causes she supported through service.\n\nBut one day, her eyesight began to wane. A bit at first and them more significantly, the result of a degenerative disease. The diagnosis changed everything. Her ability to teach and the frequency at which she could volunteer started to diminish.  Eventually, she was unable to drive and was forced to retire. The benefits she received weren’t enough to cover her essential living costs, and she was soon confronted with the choice between paying bills and buying groceries.\nWanda wasn’t sure what to do. She felt mounting discouragement. But as her worry grew, her years of work as a volunteer prompted a clear thought in her mind:look to your community for help.\nIt was a thought she heeded. On the recommendation her church, Wanda connected with Landover Hills Baptist Church, a partner of the Capital Area Food that operates a weekly food pantry known as Feed My Sheep.\nThe church’s leader, Pastor David Griesemer, was there greeting everyone with a smile.  “Each and every person that comes here is an important member of our community,” Pastor Griesemer says. “We want to make everyone feel welcome and part of the family, and we do that through kindness, dignity, and getting to know each person’s story.” His wife Sandra, who oversees the pantry’s operations, was there too, making sure each of the hundreds of attendees were checked in and ready to take home groceries.\nA volunteer guided Wanda through the produce, loaves of bread, pastas, beans, juice, meat and dairy. As she picked up each food item, she began to feel a sense of hope returning.  She walked out of the pantry that day with a bag full bag and a full heart.\nWith help stretching her food budget, the choices between food, rent,and medicine have been alleviated. Wanda no longer worries about whether she’ll have enough food to eat each week, and has taken to spending time cooking with her daughter and grandchildren – one of her favorite pass times.\nLandover Hills has become a place where Wanda considers herself to be among friends.

Following significant cuts to the food stamp program, now known as SNAP, the Capital Area Food Bank and its network began to assist people across the city and the surrounding suburbs who were reeling from the impact.\nWe’re proud of what we’ve accomplished over the past 40 years – providing better quality food, expanding the quantity and variety of foods sourced, expanding distribution options and channels throughout the region to make it easier for clients to access, and better targeting areas and clients in need. Our original and continuous grounding in social justice as the reason for our work is inspiring, and it’s with all this incredible history behind us that we begin the next stage of our journey.\nAs we celebrate the past, we’re also compelled to think about our future, and the future of our clients.  What will this region look like ten years from now?  Who are the new partners we might engage with?  What types of food and prepared meals will we provide? How will technology allow us to work differently and give our clients greater convenience as they obtain their food?  How might we use our volunteers differently?\nWe live in a region that is growing, with many jobs that are at a living wage.  But there is a gap between the skills and abilities of our clients and those in demand. There is so much we can do help remove these barriers for our clients to help them achieve these brighter futures:\n\nFood not only nourishes and sustains each one of us – it is the fuel that propels our lives and makes every other thing possible, including the bright futures we all hope for. This belief has driven our work since day one forty years ago, and continues to drive us now.  Today and every day,Food Moves Us Forward.\nTo learn more about how we’re commemorating our 40th year,sign upfor the CAFB Fresh News newsletter to hear stories from our community and to stay up-to-date on events and more.

That’s why we’re focusing on ways to better address client needs, from offering more prepared food options for seniors who may have limited ability to cook to offering more culturally appropriate options for different kinds of families. By taking these things into consideration, in the form of both ingredients for cooking and prepared meals,we’ll be able to support more customized dietary needs, reduce risks of poor health outcomes, and measure the the impact of better quality food on people’s lives.\nHaving access to healthy food throughout your life makes all the difference. The food bank’s reach across the community is wide – but there are many parts of our region where both a lack of full-service grocery stores and brick and mortar nonprofit partners make physically getting to food a challenge. That’s why we’ll be getting creative with how we make food available to communities in need, using new kinds of delivery, and harnessing existing technology and trends to create more options for our clients.\nWe’re also exploring additional methods for reaching those who need access to food, and ways to provide affordable food (vs. free alone) as an option for the communities we serve. Whether it’s bringing good food to people who need it, or bringing people to good food,these new options will make securing food easier – and will also make it easier to eat better in less time.\nWe know that people in need of food are also in need of a variety ofother resources to overcome the obstacles poverty presents. Doing this work requires more than food, and we can’t do it alone. That’s why we’re forming new partnerships with organizations — both nonprofits and for-profits — that may not distribute food as a primary part of their work, but that are addressing the root causes of food insecurity. Bundling food with programs  that enable people to get and hold jobs, stay healthier, or otherwise build more empowered, brighter futures will be making it easier for those who come to those organizations for other services to get healthy food and the services they need in one place.This saves people time, and helps to keep them coming back— increasing the odds they’ll complete a training or attend a follow up visit for medical services.\nAs technology continues to evolve, so do the opportunities toimprove the speed with which we source and deliver food, find new ways to reduce food waste in our supply chain, and stretch our resources to continuously improve services for our clients.With the availability of new tools and systems, the food bank can and will continue to evolve in ways that will save valuable time and resources, and help more good food make its way to a family’s plate rather than going into the trash. This effort will encompass all food bank activities — especially logistics, transport, technology, and systems — to enhance the efficiency of our supply chain, ensure we’re getting food to the people who need it most, and reduce time from source to table.\nSpreading and growing awareness of the hunger exists inour region — and the breadth and diversity of those it impacts — is the first step towards creating solutions.With an even greater emphasis on our clients and their needs, we will provide new and creative ways for the community to volunteer and engage with our work directly in the community. And through the collection and use of data from our pilot programs, we will gather a body of research to engage elected officials and other policymakers and advocate for policies and programs that enable the people we serve to create brighter futures. It will take the involvement of an ever-widening swath of our community—from donors and partners volunteers and advocates—to generate the resources and momentum that will enable us to continue to do more for those who need support.\n\n", "image_filenames": ["blo_581.png", "blo_582.png", "blo_583.png", "blo_584.png", "blo_585.png", "blo_586.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Radha2019Blog_Embed.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Access_opt2.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Services_opt1.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Streamline_opt1.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Awareness_opt1.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Headerv2.jpg"]}

This year was no exception. As we walked though each goal set and achieved, and the sometimes-surprising twists and challenges on the path there, the sense of pride was evident throughout the room.\nThe team knows the same thing that I do: 2019 was a remarkable year in multiple regards. Not the least of these was that it started with an entirely unprecedented government shutdown. January stretched the food bank in new ways as we mobilized ourselves and our partners to support the thousands of federal workers and contractors that were suddenly in need of emergency assistance – most for the first time in their lives.\nThat 35-day period held many lessons. Among them: that far more of our neighbors are one paycheck away from hardship than we could have possibly imagined; that a social safety net is critically important for those who fall on difficult times; and that our team and community can solve big challenges when we come together to support our neighbors.\nThe lessons of the shutdown also reinforced the thinking underlying the new five-year strategic plan that we rolled out later that winter. To build a stronger community, we must assist with meeting people’s immediate needs whilealsoworking to strengthen their longer-term financial stability. Food has the power to help do both.\nIn the immediate term, our strategic plan seeks to help us get more of the right nutritious food – including food that is appropriate for age and culture – to people who need it today, and to do so faster and smarter than ever before.  And in the longer term, we are now also working to address hunger’s root causes by partnering with other organizations, pairing food with additional services that lead to better financial and health outcomes.\nFirmly at the center of all our work are the needs and voices of those we serve.\nThis year, for the first time, we conducted a large-scale survey of our clients, collecting information from over 2,000 people and analyzing it for insights on how we can help meet their needs more effectively. It is from this place – one that is client centered, and data driven – that we are continuing to build our services and pilots.\nWe have set our strategic plan fully into motion, and throughout the spring, summer, and fall, we have developed several pilot programs to begin exploring what food and service pairings – “Food Plus”, as we currently call it – are most effective. For instance, we are working with multiple workforce development centers to deliver food to students who come for skills training, with the intention of boosting enrollment and retention rates. And we are preparing to launch multiple partnerships with health care providers to begin pairing food with health services for patients that are also dealing with food insecurity. And we have started multiple initiatives that will create access for people who want to purchase food but aren’t close to affordable retail options, including Curbside Groceries, our new grocery store on wheels, and partnerships with ride-sharing companies offering trips to the grocery store.\nCertainly, we did not accomplish any of this alone. The incredibly generous investments of our financial and food donors – some of whom have supported us for years, and some of whom are new supporters of our strategy – make everything we do possible. The same is true for the over 20,000 volunteers who come through our doors each year to donate their time, and for the state and county officials who enable many important parts of our work. The accomplishments of the year belong to a “team” that extends well beyond our walls.\n2019 has truly been remarkable. But something I appreciate most about the food bank and our community of supporters is that even as we reflect on what we’ve achieved, we refuse to stand still. And with 2020 approaching, we are running full speed towards what will be a seminal year.\nOn Martin Luther King, Jr.’s birthday this coming January, we will turn 40. And with the full momentum of our strategic plan moving us forward, we are poised to build on each of those 40 years to make a greater impact than ever before. There will be challenges and hurdles – of that I am certain. But with the strength of our team, our partners, and our community, we are as well positioned as we have ever been to help our neighbors build the brighter futures they want and deserve.  That’s an accomplishment I’m already looking forward to reflecting on next year, and in the many years to come.", "image_filenames": ["blo_587.png", "blo_588.png", "blo_589.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Embed_Shutdown_2.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Radha2019Blog_Embed.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Radha_Header2.jpg"]}

Each day, kids stream through the doors, eager to join their friends for another evening of learning, play, and good company. The first thing they ask when they arrive? “What’s for dinner, MissGwen?!”\n“Every day is different. Every day is a challenge. And every day is fun,” said Gwen Spitzoff, Community Lodgings Site Coordinator. The meal plans change from day to day, but the foundations stay the same—protein, fruit, veggies, starch and milk. “The great things about it is the kids really enjoy the food,” Gwen smiles. “They have become adventurous eaters.”\nThis is Gwen’s favorite time of day—seeing the kids enjoy a hearty meal. She says the meals, delivered daily by the CAFB and plated by Community Lodgings volunteers, fuel the kids for the rest of the afternoon. After eating, the kids work on skills such as writing and reading, followed by completing homework with theassistance of helpful volunteers. Finally, the kids enjoy “free play” time where they can socialize, play games, and just enjoy being a kid.\nBeyond being a place to grow and learn, Community Lodgings is a safe space for the kids. Community Lodgings operates transitional and affordable housing complexes. Like so many families across our region, many of the kids’ parents or caregivers work non-traditional hours or work multiple jobs to provide for their families.

{"title": "Doing More – and Better – for Seniors", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2019/10/16/doing-more-and-better-for-seniors/", "date": "October 16, 2019", "content": "Bycafb•October 16, 2019\nAs Congress reconvenes this week, the Capital Area Food Bank turns our attention and support to the Reauthorization of the Older Americans Act (OAA). Since 1965, the OAA has provided funding for programs serving 2.5 million Americans over 60 years old, with nearly $900 million annually funding programs in our mission area.\nBy Michael Waddle, CAFB Consultant, Senior Hunger Innovations.\nHunger doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Despite years of saving and planning, seniors in retirement often find themselves relying on a limited income to meet their many specialized needs. While high-dollar expenses such as rent and healthcare increase, access to necessities such as affordable, healthy food can decrease due to mobility issues, fixed income limitations, and changes in housing amenities.\nPJ Douglass is a volunteer and client at Marwood Senior Apartments in Upper Marlboro, MD, where more than 80 seniors participate in the CAFB’sSenior Brown Bagprogram. She says “most clients at Marwood are former police officers, government employees, firefighters who worked and saved throughout their lives”. But now, she adds, “They need assistance.”\nFor many, the problem compounds itself. Health incidents become more frequent as we age, and many are forced to make life adjustments to address new limitations. Many of PJ’s peers can no longer live in houses they’ve owned for decades, or in apartments that only have stairs—and they’re not alone. Seniors in their position must often move into senior friendly apartments that have a higher cost of rent. Nationally, we see that 29% of hungry seniors are living with a disability, and 45% of hungry seniors are also renters.\nBut PJ and her peers at Marwood are just a few of the Capital Area Food Bank’s 10,000 incredible senior clients. Since the 1990s, our Senior Brown Bag program has expanded to serve almost 4,300 seniors throughout the Washington Metro Area and, in recent years, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program has expended to serve almost 5,700 people in Washington, DC and Montgomery County, MD. While we, and our senior program clients, are thankful for the generosity of our area food donors and federal commodities that help make these programs possible, we also understand that seniors require special care and programs that evolve to meet their needs.\nOver the past year, the Capital Area Food Bank has been convening an advisory board of metro area seniors, like PJ, to learn more about their needs and how best to serve them. This work has informed our new Strategic Direction (2020-25) wherein we aim to provide food that is age and culturally appropriate. This means providing prepared meals in addition to the shelf-stable items that make up the cornerstone of what we provide, for those that may not have the time or ability to prepare their own meals.\nThis past summer, PJ and her clients participated in focus groups testing different types of meals—meal kits, frozen foods, and ready-to-eat meals that could be eaten cold or warm. We learned that they preferred frozen meals because it gave them a choice of when to eat the meals. And when it comes to choices, they don’t need too many options or too frequent input. They still valued and wanted their Senior Brown Bag, but also appreciated the autonomy offered by these supplemental meals that would allow them to cook, or have others cook for them, less frequently.\nAs impactful as these programs—and those funded by the OAA—are, senior hunger persists and is growing. In DC alone, 11% of people over age 60 are food insecure. Just as the CAFB focuses its efforts on research and innovation to better serve senior clients in the Greater Washington area, reauthorization of the OAA is an opportunity to ensure that the best services possible remain available for older Americans in our region and beyond.", "image_filenames": ["blo_603.png", "blo_604.png", "blo_605.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SeniorPhoto_Embed-300x225.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SeniorMtg_Embed-300x225.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SeniorBlog_Header3.jpg"]}

But before I interned for them, I didn’t know what hunger truly looked like in the DC area—or the full depth and breadth of services the food bank provides for its surrounding communities. I was one of those people who considered hunger a distant reality that I had never encountered. I grew up sheltered from those realities, and my mother protected me from ever experiencing them.\nHowever, throughout my time at the CAFB as the Hunger Lifeline Intern, many of my preconceived notions were challenged.\nIn my first week at the food bank, I shadowed different departments to understand the processes that go into running programs smoothly. I was most impacted by my ride-along with a truck driver. We distributed food to a partner site, and later picked up food donations from a Safeway warehouse. When we arrived at the partner site, I was surprised to see the long line wrapped around the outside of the church with people waiting to receive their food. While Andre, the driver, unloaded the food, I was able to speak with the church’s organizers about their food pantry and their work in the community.\nI didn’t know what a pantry looked like before this moment or with what kinds of organizations the food bank partners, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were people within these communities facing hunger that are working hard to provide these services for their neighbors. This initial exposure shaped how I approached my position, making me even more interested and motivated in my work.\nI primarily worked on improving the Hunger Lifeline service, which included speaking to clients and partners in order to make the service more user-friendly and to ensure accurate information was displayed on the food bank website. Throughout my 10 weeks, I spoke to several people in the area who are food insecure. This exposure opened my eyes to the several faces of hunger in our region, and how different hunger looks for everyone. It made me realize how close any person is to facing hunger, and how dire the problem of food insecurity is in the DC area.\nIn all, working at the CAFB made me optimistic about the work of nonprofit organizations and further inspired me to work in public health and other causes for social justice. Throughout my course work as a Global and Public Health major, I have learned that several moving parts must come together in order to make a nonprofit initiative successful and sustainable. The CAFB is making informed decisions to improve their services and tailor them to the needs of their clients. This experience also reminded me that despite there being much injustice in the world, there are people out there who do not get discouraged and continue working toward a better future.\n\n", "image_filenames": ["blo_606.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gabby_desk_Blog.jpg"]}

This means that sometimes Akiema struggles to keep up with the family’s food budget.\nWith money tight and school meals winding down, Akiema’s worry was steadily beginning to mount late year when she found out about a program near her home run by the food bank that would provide the kids with meals during the summer months, and after school during the school year.Soon, the kids were enrolled in the program – shooting hoops on the basketball court, drawing, reading, playing and most importantly, getting meals and snacks to fuel them during the summer months without access to school meals.\nIt was like a heavy weight had been lifted.\n“The program is a lifesaver,” Akiema said. “I know that while I’m at work, they’re still learning and getting their meals, and having fun.”\nWith the school year under way, both kids continue to visit the program after school, getting fuel for their minds and bodies with homework help, snacks, and a healthy dinner before heading home.\nFor Akiema, and thousands of parents like her in the area, the support of an after-school meal program is important for the food it provides, but just as important for what it removes: the burden of worry about how to make a household budget stretch in impossible ways.

Take an inside look at mealtime for Community Services\nFoundation, a CAFB partner that hosts a summer camp and provides free breakfast\nand lunch for kids throughout the summer, through the eyes of CSF’s chief\noperating officer Dawn Folkes.\nDuring a typical day at the community center, children come\nin and they are greeted by the staff.  A\nmeal is the first thing on the agenda.\n“We don’t know what children face before they come to the\ncenter or when they leave the center,” Dawn says, “but we do know that while\nthey are here they are able to get a nutritious meal.”\nFrom there, the kids jump right into homework assistance—STEM,\nreading and math tutoring. They have recreational activities—yoga on some days,\nsports activities on another. They also have health and wellness activities, as\nwell as public speaking, journaling and a host of other enrichment\nopportunities.\nThe kids eat, learn and play. Their laughter and smiles, along with the knowledge that Community Services Foundation’s partnership with the Food Bank is helping them to lead full and healthy lives, is what makes the job worth it for Dawn.\n“What I enjoy most about working here at Community Services\nFoundation, and partnering with the Capital Area Food Bank, is to see the\nsmiles on the kids’ faces, every day,” Dawn says. “It’s such a joy to know that\nwe are helping them, giving them so much enrichment to their lives.

At his church in Virginia, he’s started an 800-square-foot garden, and all the food it produces goes to the church’s food pantry.“The way I see it, so many of these churches and YMCAs and rec leagues have plenty of land,” Rob says. “The gardens could have a dual purpose – they can get local communities to spend time together outdoors and build kinships, and they can provide food to those who need it.”It’s with that vision in his mind – and his hands in the dirt – that Rob Schulman continues to take action against hunger, one tomato at time.", "image_filenames": ["blo_611.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rob-Schulman.jpg"]}

This chronic hunger has consequences,\nAudrey says. “Last year, we had a little boy named Brandon who had just started\nwith the program. Hunger was making it hard for him to sit still and focus. He\ncouldn’t get into the rhythm and routine of the camp’s transitions.”\nBrandon’s story isn’t unique. In fact, as schools close for\nthe summer, dozens of the food bank’s summer meals locations across the region\nbecome a nutrition lifeline for 200,000 children who rely on free or reduced\ncost school breakfast and lunch programs during the rest of the year.\n“The kids are really excited to come to the table to eat,”\nAudrey says of Jubilee’s daily communal breakfast. “They love trying all the\ndifferent options each day.”\nThe nutrition from breakfast and lunch is the kids’ fuel for\na day full of activity. Audrey’s younger campers go on field trips to the\nNatural History Museum, the Air and Space Museum, and other fun learning locations.\nHer older campers take swimming lessons at American University and go on an\nannual canoe trip in the Shenandoah Valley. And each child works on educational\nprojects.\nFor Brandon, routinely getting two healthy meals a day\nthroughout the summer made all the difference. Audrey noticed that by the\nsummer’s final month, Brandon was able to adapt to the camp transitions. He\ncould focus on his activities.\n“I really believe the food helped sustain him and keep him\nengaged in the program,” Audrey says. “Our summer camp is really about\nenrichment.

Using a love of food and\nhis experience in the food industry of his home country, he quickly found work\nat a restaurant in northeast D.C. “I love to cook, and this was the perfect\nopportunity to do what I love and earn a living,” Justin says.\nWithin a few years, Justin met the love of his life and they\ngot married. Soon, their new home was filling up with three children, all aged\nwithin a couple years of each other. And with each passing year, the kids grew\nbigger. “And so did their appetites,” Justin laughs.\nWith a growing family, though, came a growing budget. “I make money and have a consistent schedule, but it’s tough,” Justin says. “My wife and I don’t have much room to spare when it comes to paying bills, buying groceries, and getting the resources our kids need for academic success.”\nIncreasingly, Justin saw that the kids often seemed to lack energy and had trouble focusing on their homework. He worried that they weren’t getting enough to eat, but the budget was stretched as far as it could go. One day, though, his kids’ school notified Justin of a new partnership with the Capital Area Food Bank to offer a monthly Family Market at the school. This new partnership would help provide families with fresh fruits, vegetables and non-perishable, healthy groceries each month right at the school.\n“I was so excited,” Justin says. “I thought, wait, I can go\nonce a month and fill a giant bag full of fruits, vegetables, and other good\nfood? I was ecstatic. I’ve been coming here ever since. This market has been a\nhuge help for my family.”\nWith more healthy food added into the family’s diet, Justin\nhas noticed an improvement in the kids’ energy levels. His oldest will enter\neighth grade this fall, and will soon be hard at work on applications to get\ninto the best middle schools. “I’m just so happy she’ll have the food she’ll\nneed to focus on her studies and applications,” Justin grins.

He’s worked in enoughfood-insecure regionsto understand what the look often signifies:hunger.\nWhen Clint was hired by Mount Vernon Woods Elementary School to be its principal three years ago, he noticed the same issue. One 8-year-old named Christian, for example, wasn’t concentrating at all in his classes. His single mom was working and putting herself through school at the time, and alimited budgetmeant there wasn’t always enough food on the table at home.\nChristian\nwasn’t the only child at the school experiencing hunger. Clint knew he needed\nto do something, so he came up with an idea: make Mount Vernon Woods a community\nhub, with food at the heart of it.\n“My big\nthing is really that for us to deal with student academic success, we must first\ntake care of the basic needs of our families,” Clint says. “We want our\nstudents to be physically and mentally healthy so that they can excel in the\nclassroom.”\nClint instituted several programs to help kids and their families, including physical and mental health screenings, and applications for SNAP and Medicaid benefits all right at the school. And to help provide nutritious food for the school’s children during times that school breakfast and lunch don’t cover, Clint signed on as a partner in the Capital Area Food Bank’sFamily Market Program. For the last three years, the Food Bank and Clint’s coworkers have coordinated a free, monthly market-style grocery distribution at the school, complete with fresh produce and shelf-stable groceries.\nWith healthy food in their stomachs, students are able to focus on their school work,free from hunger pangs.Knowing the kids have the food they need to succeed during the school year brings a smile to Clint’s face. But there is one more component to his “central hub” idea: dealing with summer hunger.\n“We worry\nabout it. A lot. Especially this time of year. Summer is one of our biggest\nconcerns,” Clint says. “Because we know that without free breakfast and lunch,\nand the family market, many of our kids are more vulnerable to hunger over the\nsummer—a time that we just want them to be able to have fun and play with their\nfamily and friends.”\nClint reached out to Fairfax County Food Services and together they began hosting a daily summer barbeque at the school.  And more, Clint has helped make his families aware of the Capital Area Food Bank’ssummer meal servicesin Virginia, which are available at a variety of locations in the community that include apartment buildings, public recreation centers, and places of worship.\nWith help from the Food Bank, Clint has accomplished his goal of making Mount Vernon Woods a year-round hub for the community. But what’s really important, he says, is the kids and their goals.\nWith\nyear-round food assistance, he’s seen a marked improvement in student academic\nperformance. Christian, the student that helped inspire Clint to enhance the\nschool’s support for families, is now 10 and hitting middle school in stride. Clint\nhas noticed this same improvement in many other students as well. “We will\nalways work to ensure our students are free from hunger,” Clint said. “Keeping\nstudents fed is the key to student success in the classroom.” And with food and\nsupport year-round, that success can extend well beyond school, paving the path\nto a bright future.", "image_filenames": ["blo_617.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/190501_FamilyMarket_RedskinsCampbells_00063.jpg"]}

After she went off to high school and college, she continued to volunteer\nat the site as often as she could, and after graduation, she was offered a\nfull-time position as a site coordinator.\nMuch of Cierra’s adult life has been dedicated to helping the next generation of kids at Little Lights. “Our students come to us really excited after school,” Cierra explains. “Each day begins with community time, when we’re able to play games, get to know them, and ask them about their days at school.” Afterwards, the students go through three rotations—homework time, recreation time, and dinner time.\nAs it does for most of its After School Meal program partners, the food bank delivers meals to Little Lights every day during the week. Each meal consists of a protein, a vegetable, a fruit, grains, and milk. To Cierra, this is one of the most important aspects of the after-school program, as many of the children are part of families struggling with food insecurity. Some children may not have dinner waiting for them at home.\n“While the parents are\nworking, their kids are able to come here and receive a complete meal,” Cierra\nsays. “Their families can be confident that the student is well-fed when they\ncome home in the evening.”\nWith full stomachs, the\nkids can focus on homework – each child receives tutoring help. Once they\nfinish school work though, it’s off to the recreation room for games and other\nactivities that allow the kids to explore their creativity.\nWith the school-year\nending, Cierra reflects on the past school year, and beams about the growth\nshe’s seen in the children. She says she’s also glad that the program will\ncontinue over the summer, which schools are closed and free school lunch isn’t\navailable.\n“I am really proud of\nwhat we do here at Little Lights. Thanks to the Capital Area Food Bank, we’re able\nto provide those healthy complete meals for our students all year, and that\nwill continue into the summer. And then on top of that, we provide academic\nassistance for our students, and just push them forward to live successfully\nand thrive in their lives.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_626.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cierra.png"]}

They provide one of the essential first steps in getting food to the men, women, and children we serve, doing everything from sorting and packing food, to bagging apples, greens, potatoes, and other produce; to going into the community and distributing food directly through our programs. In honor of National Volunteer Month, here are five amazing things our volunteers helped accomplish this past year!\n1. Packed 25 million total pounds of food food – enough for 20 million meals – for those in need.\nThis past year, more than 20,000 volunteers streamed through our doors to help pack bags, sort food, and pack produce for the community, allowing us to save millions of dollars in labor costs that can instead be used to source and procure more food for those in need. Our volunteers contributed over 50,000 volunteer hours throughout the year and helped pack 25 million total pounds of food, which translates to 20 million healthy meals for the community.\n2. Helped the food bank operate 10 direct distribution programs.\nWhile the\nfood bank works with a network over 450 other nonprofit partners, we also bring\nfood directly into the community through several direct distribution programs. Operating\nthese programs means that we need to pack and distribute food ourselves, and\nvolunteers help us do that.\nVolunteers packed bags and boxes of monthly supplemental groceries for the over 10,000 seniors served by ourGrocery PlusandSenior Brown Bagprograms, as well as bags of food for the 2,500 children who receive food through ourWeekend Bagprogram, which ensures they won’t be hungry when school meals aren’t available.\n3. Packaged 30,000 pounds of fresh produce a week for furloughed federal employees and contractors during the government shutdown.\nWhen the\ngovernment shut down for a record 34 days in December and January, hundreds of\nthousands of federal employees and government contractors were left without\npaychecks for two pay periods, forcing many to worry how they’d be able to pay\nbills and still afford groceries. To meet the unexpected need, the food banklaunched\nfree marketsacross the region each Saturday of the shutdown. In\norder to move quickly, the food bank needed help, so it put the call out for\nextra volunteers.\nThat\ncall was answeredas 80 volunteers a week converged on the food\nbank’s distribution center, rolled up their sleeves, and got to work. They packaged\n30,000 pounds of produce for the markets each Thursday, and their efforts\nhelped 4,200 federal employees and their families get support during the\nshutdown.\n4. Staffed our Community Marketplaces, rain or shine.\nCommunity\nMarketplacesare monthly farmer’s market-inspired food\ndistributions, located in high-density areas with high rates of food\ninsecurity. The food bank operates three per month, and each one requires a\nminimum of 40 volunteers to set up and break down tables and tents, operate\nproduce stands, and staff cooking demonstrations.\nAs the\nmarkets are outdoors, volunteers have had to deal with all sorts of weather\nconditions—95-degree heat in the high summer months, brisk temperatures in the\nwinter months, and sometimes rainy or windy conditions. Yet no matter the weather,volunteers showed up\nevery time—choosing to spend a day of their weekend helping others.\n5. Further supported a culture of giving and a knowledge of the issue of hunger among corporations.\nImpact Day.\nGive-Back Day. Day of Service. The days that corporations, schools, and other\nlarge groups spend with the Capital Area Food Bank go by many names, but they\nall have one thing in common: they make a difference.\nThis past year, nearly 600 companies spent time volunteering with the food bank. Employees of these companies invested valuable staff time to come to the food bank and learn more about the issue of hunger, and to help their neighbors in need.", "image_filenames": ["blo_632.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/190111_Volunteers_GovtShutdown00032.jpg"]}

{"title": "Inside Look: How Fighting Hunger Also Helps the Planet", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2019/04/05/inside-look-how-fighting-hunger-also-helps-the-planet/", "date": "April 5, 2019", "content": "Bycafb•April 5, 2019\nIn a land of\nabundant food, there is also abundant waste. In fact, 40% of the food produced\nin the United States goes uneaten. To be a part of the solution to this\nproblem, the food bank has made reducing food waste a core tenant; it’s part of\nour organizational DNA. Here are a few ways the food bank works to reduce food\nwaste and help more people get access to the nutritious food they need.\nHow We Reduce Food Waste in Our Region\nThe food\nbank’s model is to make sure that retailers or others who have an excess supply\nof good, nutritious food can make it available for people in need, rather than\ndiscarding it. Much of that food comes to the food bank directly.\nBut when\nretailers have smaller amounts of food to donate (a few crates of milk, or a\nfew boxes of frozen vegetables), it is not feasible for the stores to send\ntrucks to the food bank, so it becomes more likely the food gets wasted. A few\nyears ago, these grocers looked to the food bank for assistance.\nOur\nsolution: working smarter by making a direct connection between our network of\nnonprofit partners and our retail donors. Through our partner direct model, 60\nof our partners in DC, MD and VA pick donations up right from grocers.\nThe results:\ntransportation costs are saved for both the food bank and the grocer, and\nmillions of pounds of good food from 238 retailers makes it way to the tables\nof families in our area, rather than into a landfill. Last year alone, the\nPartner Direct program saved 5.8 million pounds of food, which equates to 4.8\nmillion more meals for the community.\nHow We Reduce Waste in Our Daily Operations\nDuring the\ncourse of a year,more than 25\nmillion pounds of foodget delivered to and sorted at the food bank\nfor eventual delivery to over 450 community partners and 10 direct distribution\nprograms. With such a massive amount of food going through our system, it is\nlikely that some of that food will be unfit to serve to the community. Small\namounts of food may be spoiled or spill during the sorting or packing process.\nThis is where the food bank’s partnership with local cattle farmer Bobby\nWojciechowski comes in. All spoiled or spilt food gets poured into certain bins\nthat we then send to Bobby, who uses the food to feed his cattle.\nAnother way\nthe food bank stays sustainable is by creatively repurposing food waste in ourUrban\nDemonstration Garden, a half-acre urban farm attached to the DC\nWarehouse where partner agencies and community members can learn how to grow healthy,\nnutritious food in the urban environment. Hillary Quarles, the food bank’s food\ngrowing education specialist, makes compost from a variety of food waste\nproducts – any part of a plant from the garden that is not consumed, kitchen\nscraps from the food bank’s demonstration kitchen, and more. Through a natural\ncomposting process, the vegetable matter turns back into soil and is re-used in\nthe gardening process.\nHow We Reduce Food Waste Through Education\nIn addition\nto reducing food waste through our partner direct program and internally during\noperations, the food bank seeks to educate the community about reducing food\nwaste. OurNutrition\nEducation teamregularly conducts cooking demos both at the food\nbank and at partner and program sites. During these demos, our Nutrition\nEducation Coordinator Katherine Donnelly makes sure to give plenty of tips\nregarding food waste. “Use the stems of kale, chards and collard in soups or as\nan extra crunch in salads.” “Pickle the rind of a watermelon.” “Collect the\nzest of citrus and use it to add flavor to your next meal.” Katherine’s number\none tip? “Make a food budget and meal plan; it is the sure-fire way to reduce\nfood waste. Knowing what you will eat and when helps ensure that nothing spoils\nwhile hiding in a corner of your fridge.”\nLearn More\nAbout How the Food Bank Fights Against Food Waste", "image_filenames": ["blo_634.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_4755.jpeg"]}

At the Capital Area Food Bank, the start of the growing season is an exciting time for Hillary Quarles – the food growing education specialist. She manages our Urban Demonstration Garden, a half-acre urban farm outside our D.C. warehouse where we grow delicious veggies throughout the spring and summer. To Hillary, the garden is a place to teach people how to grow healthy, nutritious food in an urban environment. “Learning how to garden is an experience that connects you to nature and to the world of fresh produce,” she says.\nOne of the ways we grow our plants is through urban garden plots and container gardens. These small plots and containers are great tools for growing veggies in a city environment. Hillary’s mission is to teach as many people as she can how to build them because, as she notes, “the more people who know how to garden, the more healthy produce we’re able to provide to our neighbors who may be in need.”\nTo that end, Hillary regularly hosts “how to build an urban garden” workshops for the food bank’s nonprofit partners— soup kitchens, food pantries, faith-based organizations and others. These partners then take what they’ve learned tostart their own garden plots and container gardens, and they use the resulting produce for their community.\nThe best thing about urban gardens, Hillary says, is that absolutely anyone can grow healthy, nutritious veggies. Families with limited resources or space can build a small plot in a backyard, or even plant container pots on a windowsill or balcony. Volunteers coming by the food bank can learn how to get growing wherever they live. You too can build a container garden by following the directions we’ve compiled below!\u0002\nA small container or pot for the plants and a bucket for mixing soil, a drill, rocks, soil, fertilizer, water, a small shovel, and seedlings!\nTaking a small container, drill holes in the bottom so\nthe water can drain. This is a crucial step, because you can drown the plants\nif you don’t do this!\nThis will allow for better drainage at the base of the container. Make sure you put on gloves for this part!\nYou’ll want to make sure you add enough water so that the soil is dampened to the consistency of a damp sponge.\nDon’t pack the soil tight. Smooth the top of the soil to\nmake an even surface.\nThese are where the small plants will go. You’ll want to dig the holes about two inches deep and space out the holes so the plant have room to grow.\nCarefully remove the seedlings from small pot and place the seedling in the hole. Gently fill the hole around the plant so that the stem and leaves are above the soil line.  Don’t pack it down!\nWater the soil to a damp consistency once all planting has been completed.\nIf you’re interested in learning more about gardening, ourUrban Gardenholds demonstrations throughout the year.You can also spend time volunteering in our garden.

It’s National Nutrition Month and we honor the culinary imagination it takes to make food go further with what’s on hand. This month, we pour our hearts into pancakes because they are kind on the budget, cross over the lines of sweet and savory, and are kid friendly to name just a few reasons. Our carrot cake pancake recipe is affordable—it serves four for just $1.90. Our recipe cards were created to ensure that families in the community have access to healthy, affordable recipes to use with the food they receive at Food Bank and partner distributions.Learn more!\nNow, without further ado, let’s talk about making pancakes! As you innovate in the pan this month, hold these pancake insights near and dear:\nPancake Key IngredientsFlour, baking powder, baking soda, eggs, milk (or nut milk), oil and spices. These are the bones of a good pancake. With these on hand pancakes can happen at a moment’s notice.\nKids in the KitchenKids love making pancakes! I’ve tested this in my own kitchen with my 3 ½ and 6 ½ year old. From the stirring to the measuring to the mixing to adding the raisins, kids’ hands will be happy making these.\nSwap it OutNo Carrots? Shred a zucchini, wrap in a cloth towel and ring out the liquid. Use in place of the carrot. Or shred a sweet potato, cook in the microwave 2 minutes and toss it into the batter.\nMake it a MealCan pancakes be a meal? Absolutely. Our carrot cake pancake recipe already hits the whole grain and veggie targets. For protein, shmear on some peanut butter OR mix in some shredded cheddar cheese to the batter and your gold OR add a generous dollop of Greek yogurt\nA Savory SuggestionInstead of cinnamon, use curry powder and add some frozen or canned peas to the batter. Top pancakes with plain yogurt mixed with chopped cilantro.\nWaste Less FoodPancakes are a hearty vessel that can hold any of your fruits or veggies that are on the brink. Here we use carrots, bananas, apples, sweet potato, finely chopped steamed broccoli, corn or chopped spinach are all viable pancake additions. Adding shredded cheese to veggie based pancakes make these a savory winner. Topping yogurt and honey or a nut butter sweeten the deal with fruit filled pancakes.\nWaste Less FoodPancakes are a hearty vessel that can hold any of your fruits or veggies that are on the brink.

Pairing that food with education is also important so that people have the ingredients and knowledge to make nutritious, budget-friendly meals.\nCreating and distributing those recipes, each of which feeds a family of four for $7 or less, is where the food bank’sNutrition Educationteam comes in.  Along with professional chefs, these team members developCAFB recipesthat are taste-tested by food bank staff and partners and then made available as educational resources at all of our program and partner sites, including schools, after-school centers, and community centers.Katherine Donnelly, CAFB’s nutrition education coordinator, says the real test is whether the kids like them!\n“Parents tend to assume their child is not going to like something,” Katherine says. But all that can change with a taste of the right recipe. She occasionally attends Family Markets (free, school-based markets for families) to conduct cooking demonstrations and recipe samplings, and recalls a recent visit where she made sautéed cabbage with noodles. It was a hit. “One girl loved the cabbage so much, she pulled up a chair to sit for a few minutes, helping herself to multiple samples!”\nFamilies often mention that these demonstrations have helped change the way they prepare food, Katherine shares. “They say things like ‘I would never have put those ingredients together!’ and, ‘I can’t wait to make this for my kids tomorrow.’”\nIn response to the prevalence of diet-related health conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes in low-income communities, the nutrition team has also developedwellness standards for recipe cards. The bilingual cards, both in English and in Spanish, use the types of foods commonly distributed by the food bank, and give basic instructions on how to prepare the ingredients for maximizing flavor and nutrition.\nThe cards have flown off the shelves since their introduction. In the last nine months alone, the CAFB has provided nearly 25,000 recipe cards directly into the community – each one an opportunity for someone to try exploring a new, healthy meal.\nInterested in trying out one of these recipes (which include everything from BBQ turkey mini burgers to spicy eggplant) for yourself?Take a peek at our recipe listand choose from among dozens of nutritious and delicious options!", "image_filenames": ["blo_642.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/JFM.jpg"]}

Owned and operated by the Miller Family since 1840, the farm has been an important part of getting produce to the men, women and children we serve.\nBrad and Phil Miller are quick to share their reasons for partnering with the CAFB. Brad talks about his own experience witnessing people who don’t know how to prepare fresh vegetables. “People lose sight of nutritious produce due to quick access to [fast] food … that temporarily fills us up, but lacks the nutrients to sustain a diet,” Brad says. “If we decide to eat healthy on a regular basis, I believe we wouldn’t have a lot of the health issues we have. And food just tastes better when it comes right out of the field.”\nHow does that food get to those who need it?\nIn the heart of Prince Georges County, acres of collard greens are grown for the CAFB; eggplants, bell peppers, cucumbers, cantaloupes, cabbage, and winter squash round out the harvest.\nNext, they’re harvested and packed up in bins and crates to head to the food bank.\nOnce the produce arrives at the food bank from the farm, our nonprofit partners have the opportunity to pick which items they’ll provide to their communities. When David Griesemer, Sr. Pastor of our partner Landover Hills Baptist Church, picked up produce last summer, he remarked, “A lot of our folks really appreciate the produce because it’s fresh and you offer such a variety.”\nWe also deliver some of that produce directly to kids and families at our Joyful Markets in Wards 7 and 8. It doesn’t get any more farm to table–or in this case, farm to food bank to client–than this.\nJoin the Movement.", "image_filenames": ["blo_643.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Miller-Farms-14-e1481833968993.jpg"]}

{"title": "Empowering Women Through Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2019/03/08/empowering-women-through-food-and-nutrition/", "date": "March 8, 2019", "content": "ByMark Iandolo•March 8, 2019\n“Every night when I go to sleep, I’m eager for tomorrow to come, so I can get back to work,” says Joyce Seamans, manager of a food pantry operated by Adventist Community Services of Greater Washington (ACSGW) in partnership with the Capital Area Food Bank. “Every day, I get to help resilient women of many different backgrounds gain access to healthy, nutritious food.”\nJoyce is in the middle of giving a tour of ACSGW, where she has worked for the past decade. ACSGW serves more than 1,000 people per year, the majority of whom are women—single mothers with young children, seniors, immigrants, victims of domestic abuse. Joyce knows many of these women personally. She’s listened to their stories and she considers them her friends. That’s why she’s driven to help. She knows ACSGW can help empower them. She helps them with their food needs—Joyce is particularly proud of the produce section and CAFB recipe cards. She’s even more proud of her cohort of volunteers who take time out every day to help run the pantry. “We come together as a group here dedicated to helping feed people.”\nOne of these people, Althea, has just come to ACSGW for the first time. A 20-year veteran of the local banking industry, Althea lost her job a little over six months ago when her bank closed down. Six months later, her federal unemployment benefits ran out and Althea suddenly found herself confronted with choices she had never had to deal with before. “How am I going to keep up with rent, bills, and groceries?” Althea remembers saying to herself. The stress of finding employment was hard enough, but now she was dealing with the worry of keeping her fridge stocked and her electricity from going out.\nWith her stress mounting, Althea turned to her Adventist faith group, who told her about ACSGW. Finding this pantry, Althea says, has rejuvenated her for the job search. “I’ve worked hard all my life, and I’m still working hard,” Althea says. “I spend most of my day each day looking for employment and going on interviews. I’m hoping something will work out soon. But until then, I need some help. Luckily, I found ACSGW.”\nAnother member of the community, Naana, uses food and nutrition to improve her life during retirement. Naana is a native of Ghana and worked in home healthcare in Maryland for a number of years. Like many seniors in our region, however, her income didn’t enable her to put away enough to last through retirement.  Like Althea, Naana found ACSGW through her faith and friends. She attends the pantry regularly, picking up oranges, celery, potatoes, onions and more. She also participates in nutrition classes run by Joyce, and has developed a passion for cooking. With ACSGW and the food bank’s help, Naana is able to stay healthy in retirement.\nKen Flemmer, ACGSW’s executive director, recounts the story of another woman served by the center. Fatima, a young mother, showed up on ACGSW’s doorstep before the facility opened one morning, having fled from her home with her kids because of domestic abuse. ACSGW helped her through the trauma.\n“Unfortunately, stories like Fatima’s are all too common,” Ken says. “People, many of whom are women, through no fault of their own are struggling to survive abuse, job loss, poverty and hunger. But ACSGW provides case management, clothing, emergency financial assistance, technology education and job training to help members of the community lift themselves out of poverty. Food is a crucial element of that that lift.”\nAnd it’s what\ngets Joyce jumping out of bed in the morning. “It’s a blessing working here. With\nhelp from my coworkers and the food bank, I get to help empower women.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_645.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/190228_PartnerSite_Adventist_00003-1.jpg"]}

She works with our partners and many of our neighbors in the community, teaching them about nutritious food options for people dealing with strapped budgets. As part of National Nutrition Month, we asked Katherine to tell us about her background, her role here, and her involvement in helping people who are dealing with hunger and the nutrition issues that come along with food insecurity.\n1. What does your role at the Food Bank\nentail?\nThe actual\nfood! I get to make the recipes come to life in our awesome training kitchen\nwith various community groups and provide samplings for staff and shopping\npartners. I choose foods and recipes to promote to our shopping partners based\non our most current inventory. I also look for avenues in our programming to\ndistribute all of our nutrition education materials. Additionally, I run our\nPartners for Wellness Grant Program which recognizes partners for prioritizing\nwellness foods from our inventory.\nI also conduct\nmonthly workshops for shopping partners. These courses teach partners and the\nneighbors they serve about healthy food selection, budgeting, cooking, AND\ngrowing. One partner, Jose Gonzalez, recently emailed after a workshop and said\nhe walked away with a better appreciation for what it takes to put a healthy\nmeal option together. “I learned how simple this can be, and I learned about\nthe free and low-priced food options available through the food bank,” he said.\nMy role also\ninvolves attending some of our family markets and mobile markets to conduct cooking\ndemonstrations and recipe demonstrations. Those in the community who attend\nthese events to receive food can come to my table and learn about recipes they\ncan make with the food they are getting. Many families have mentioned how these\ndemonstrations have helped change the way they prepare food for dinners, school\nlunches and more. “I would never have put those ingredients together!” someone\nwill say, or “I can’t wait to make this for my son tomorrow.”\nI also take\npart in local food policy councils and working groups, and am currently\ndeveloping a volunteer program to place culinary-minded volunteers in our communities\nduring food distributions to promote wellness through home cooking using CAFB\nrecipes.\n2. What are you most proud of during your\ntime here?\nGetting\npeople to like vegetables they swore they would not eat is always a bright spot,\nand establishing myself as a resource for our clients, partners and\noccasionally staff ????!\n3. What are a couple of your favorite\nrecipes that the Food Bank uses in its recipe card program and why?\nAnything\nwith lentils! Curried Lentils in the winter and Lemony Lentil Salad in the\nspring/summer.\nI also love West\nAfrican Sweet Potato Stew. I served in the Peace Corps in Cameroon and peanut\n(groundnut) soup is one of the few things I remembered how to make. This stew\nrecipe reminds me of those flavors and expands people’s perceptions of peanut\nbutter beyond a PB&J. It is also the kind of recipe that allows you to use\nup canned, fresh, or frozen vegetables without having to strictly follow the\nrecipe.\n4. What is one of your favorite\nfood-related memories in your life?\nI have been\nfortunate to travel through school and work, so this could also be a very long\nlist! One of the most powerful food experiences I have had was during a\nvolunteering trip in Jordan with Habitat for Humanity. We worked on building\nthe walls of a new home and each day we were provided lunch and dinner in the\nhomes of community members. Every evening for dinner, our volunteer team had\namazing food prepared by the Jordanian families we worked side by side with.\nEvery meal ended with tea and long, insightful conversations. It was a few\nyears ago now, but I remember those flavors very well!\n5. What’s your favorite part of working at\nthe CAFB?\nOur mission\nand our team. Knowing you are spending the majority of your waking hours during\nthe week to improve the lives of others is an honor. We have a great staff here\nand my job allows me to interact with every department as well as with the\ncommunities we serve on a daily basis.

Katherine’s role at the Food Bank involves working with our partners and directly with community members who use our services. She provides nutrition education through affordable-recipe training and cooking demonstrations. For people who are struggling with hunger, eating a nutritious diet is critical for staying healthy.\nThis is what Katherine had to say:\nLearn how to cook! Being confident in the kitchen will allow you to improvise based on your circumstance. Understanding how to construct a meal based on the balance of macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein, and fat) with micronutrient(vitamins & minerals)-rich ingredients will be great for your budget and your body. Understanding how flavors work together will help that improvisation.\nLearning how to cook and be confident in the kitchen has been beneficial to many of our partners and community members. One woman, Spring, recently told me that by learning how to cook, she’s now able to find unique ways to utilize all her food—extra apples or oranges become a mid-morning juice, for example.\nEvery culture has some great yet very basic dish that lends itself to the comfort food category. Those dishes tend to also be very nutritious! The various combinations of starches and beans are a great guide: I am a fan of gallo pinto from Costa Rica and Nicaragua; koshary from Egypt; red beans and rice from NOLA; ribollita from Italy; veggie pho with tofu from Vietnam; and lentils and injera from Ethiopia. I could easily make a much longer list.\nI love to introduce people to an inexpensive way to elevate their nutrient intake with plant-based protein powerhouses like beans and lentils; loads of nutrients for a fraction of the price of many animal products. When I do recipe demo’s at our family markets, many parents are interested to learn how much protein is packed into beans and lentils! They are often excited to add more beans and lentils to their growing kids’ dinners.\nTip #4: Shop in season! This is especially important for those who do not eat meat. It is important to educate yourself on the local seasons and shop accordingly. The more in-season the food is, the less distance it has to travel so it will be cheaper and retain more of those essential nutrients! Plus, when you shop in season, you are contributing to the local business.\nFlavor your food without depending on excess salt, fat, or sugar. Experiment with spices and spice blends. Many grocery stores feature small spice packets for less than $1 that you can use in a variety of ways. Growing fresh herbs is an inexpensive way to supply yourself with fresh flavor, I am currently growing cilantro on my bedroom windowsill that gets loads of sun. I use lemons and limes all the time in cooking to brighten and enhance flavors, and not just the juice! Adding lemon zest (the outside of the fruit, think of better way to describe) to pasta dishes and salad dressings are great; lime zest in salsas and salads; orange zest on yogurt or stir fry; leftover citrus to flavor your water; etc. If the fresh citrus is expensive or out of season, I do not mind using the bottle concentrated juices that last a while in your refrigerator and are affordable. I use honey and apple sauce as natural sweeteners as well.", "image_filenames": ["blo_650.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Photo-Finished-Recipe.jpg"]}

Very cold.  But GEICO’s fleet of volunteers was bundled up and ready to serve anyway.  The job at hand was too important to do otherwise.\nIn the face of an ongoing government furlough, thousands of people in the region were suddenly confronting tight budgets and for many, food was the first expense to be reduced to make ends meet.

For many of our neighbors, this means increased worry about being able to pay bills and still afford groceries for their families.\nTo meet the need, the food bank has launched free pop-up markets across the region each Saturday of the shutdown – based on locations with high concentrations with federal employees – to distribute produce and other grocery items to federal workers and contractors.\nSince the markets began, thousands of people have visited the distributions. In the first week alone, the food bank saw over 2,400 individuals come through – nearly double the 1250 expected.\nOne of these guests, Jana B., mentioned that she attended the market because she is staring down a large student loan payment for the degree that helped land her current federal role.\nAnother guest, Tracey G., is a federal employee of 27 years and a mother of three. Food from the pop up is helping the family stretch their resources.  “Once I opened the box,” she said, “I told my youngest ‘we have enough food right here to make family meals for a few days.'”\nTracey is worried about what a longer shutdown could do to her family.\n“Things have only gotten a little rough for us so far,” she said, “but if this shutdown goes on much longer, we’ll be in trouble.”\nAs the weeks wear on, and the strain continues on family budgets, more federal workers like Jana and Tracey are likely to be in need of support.  The food bank will continue to be operating weeklyfree grocery distributionsfor federal workers and contractors until the shutdown is over and workers are once again receiving paychecks. In addition to these distributions, federal employees can seek food through the food bank’s network of partners; a searchable directory can be foundhere.\n\n\n", "image_filenames": ["blo_660.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/190112_GovtShutdown_PopUpMarket_Brentwood_00018-2.jpg"]}

The project they had shown up to help with was another first: packaging 30,000 pounds of produce for pop up grocery distributions that would operate the next morning specifically for those whose federal offices had been shuttered, or who were working without pay.\nIn addition to the college students, corporate groups, and service corps members helping out, there were also volunteers with a very personal connection to the day’s activities.\nAlethea Boss, who works for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), is one of the region’s 362,000 federal employees. She was on hand out of a desire to help others who might be experiencing hardship. While Boss has savings now to see her through the shutdown, she remembers when that wasn’t the case.\n“When I was working in New York City earlier in my career at a different GS level, I was living paycheck to paycheck,” said Boss. “I remember quite well what that was like. You never know what’s going to happen in your life, and I’m here volunteering because I want to give back. I want to give back to the country that I love by giving back to people”.\nAs Alethea put onions into bags, Pamela Leftrict, a policy analyst with the EPA, packed carrots and apples nearby.\n\nPamela noted, as she packaged the food, that she would also be among those coming to pick up some of the fruits and vegetables the next day. Like many federal employees and contractors, she is concerned about making ends meet and is seeing her budget stretched increasingly thin with no income.\n“I need the extra help right now,” she said. “This is a scary time for me, especially because I have a child at home. Volunteering makes me feel like I’m contributing, like I’m giving something back for what I receive.”\nShe’s planning to bring her son to volunteer as well, she says, because she feels it’s important for him to see how people can help each other.  She’s also spreading the word about the food bank’s pop up distributions to other people she knows who are affected by the shutdown.\n“I’m telling them ‘this is not your fault’,” she said, though she’s finding that many in her situation are not yet willing to seek assistance.\n“I guess you never think you’re going to be the one who needs help. But sometimes we’re closer than we think.”\nBeginning 1/12, the food bank will be operating weeklyfree grocery distributionsfor federal workers and contractors until the shutdown is over and workers are once again receiving paychecks.

But the wind and temperature didn’t deter the 236 families from the community who had gathered for fresh produce at the free outdoor farmer’s market.\nTo help serve the many people who rely on the market, the food bank in turn relies on enthusiastic volunteers to help run the market’s stations. And on this particular day, the volunteers on hand – 40 students known as “midshipmen” from the Naval Academy – were those who are serving others in more ways than one.\nMembers of the Midshipmen Action Group (MAG), an organization that prepares Academy students for future service by building peer leadership, teamwork, character development, morale, selflessness, and good will toward others, were on deck to hand out potatoes, onions, cabbage, carrots and other items. Over the course of the morning, they provided food for 13,183 meals to the community. And when they finished taking down the tables and tents, they formed a shoulder-to-shoulder line that spread the length of the street and picked up every single item of trash. Marian Peele, head of the food bank’s direct distributions, happened to be on site that morning. “It was incredible,” she said. The whole street was spotless!”\nWhy did these 40 volunteers travel nearly an hour from Annapolis to spend a Saturday morning distributing produce, setting up tents, and picking up trash? A spirit of service.\n“They absolutely want to do it,” says Miriam Stanicic, director of community engagement at the Naval Academy. Students enroll to make a difference. “They’ve raised their hand to protect the nation, but they aren’t waiting until graduation to do so. Their work starts now.”\nIn addition to projects like the Community Marketplace, members provide job training for formerly incarcerated individuals, teach resume-writing classes, and serve food to individuals struggling with hunger, among other activities.\nMAG members, like many volunteers, are balancing service with busy schedules.\nMembers Alex and Preston are among them. Alex, who wants to be a pilot, took time out of his aeronautical studies to volunteer at the market. Preston, who usually works at Navy football games on Saturdays, spent his only Saturday off to volunteer.  And their friend Caleb, who served in the Marines before coming to the Academy in the hopes of becoming an officer, notes that his studies won’t prevent his service. “School is tough,” he said, “but I still try and volunteer every other weekend.”\nStanicic feels that MAG is indicative of “a new wave of leadership in America’s youth.”  With the group set to volunteer with the food bank at least twice a semester moving forward, it is a wave that the food bank is pleased to be a part of.\n", "image_filenames": ["blo_666.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4409.jpg"]}

He was deployed to Ethiopia, and later to Panama and Germany. He spent eleven years serving his country – first as an analyst and then as a warrant officer – before returning to the US and joining the workforce as a civilian. He would spend the next twenty plus years working in the private and public sectors.As retirement neared, Warren was looking forward to spending time relaxing and pursuing his hobbies, including rooting for the Washington Redskins, keeping up with politics, cooking, and traveling. But, he soon found that his income during retirement didn’t match the rising costs of Washington, D.C. He struggled financially. Groceries became harder and harder to afford. Eventually, he lost his house.After stints of living with various friends and family in an effort to stabilize his life, Warren was forced to face the reality that he needed help. He turned to Capital Area Food Bank partner Access Housing Inc., a nonprofit program focused on assisting veterans with food, transitional housing, job training, and other services.Warren still remembers the day he came to Access, breaking down as he was shown his room. It had been years since he had had a bed of his own, let alone, as he said, his “own four walls”. Regular nutritious meals were also a change from his current diet. He began to feel that change was possible.Dwayne Jones, a program coordinator with Access, said that the organization helps men and women of many ages and military backgrounds to find permanent housing, navigate a system of benefits that can enable them to regain stability, and set other goals appropriate to their circumstances and life stage.Warren noted that the food bank is an essential enabler of this work. “By partnering with the food bank on meals, we’re able to create more room in the budget for case management, housing counseling, job counseling, motivational speakers, a staff therapist, and the on-site medical clinic,” Dwayne said. “This ensures a robust program for our veterans to work their way toward their goals.” Goals like the ones Warren has set for himself, which include having a home of his own once again, and enough income to see him through the rest of retirement.He still dreams of traveling and cooking, looking forward to the day when he has a kitchen of his own where he can, as he likes to say, make “meals for anyone’s taste buds.” With food and support to fuel his journey, Warren is looking towards a hopeful future a bit more like the one he envisioned.Twenty percent of the households served by the Capital Area Food Bank have a member who is a veteran of the US military.Your supporthelps these former service members, along with hundreds of thousands of other men, women, and children in our area, to get the food they need today, and fuels a network of nonprofit partners that provide services to help them thrive tomorrow.", "image_filenames": ["blo_673.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/181107_VeteranInterview_Warren_00006.jpg"]}

Pam, a DC native in her mid-60s, had recently gone into semi-retirement after working at a major utility company for two decades. Accumulated stress injuries to her back and hands precluded her from continuing to work full time, so she took on a part-time job doing office administration work at a temp agency. With the part-time job and benefits she had accrued from her time at the utility company, Pam was set for retirement.\nThen her father, a World War II veteran, needed caring for, and she moved him into her house. It was an adjustment, but nothing compared to the change that would happen shortly thereafter. Her niece, while working to her overcome substance abuse issues, asked if her three high-spirited children could come to live with Pam. Suddenly, the house was filled with two boys and one girl, ages 7, 9, and 12. Whether they were worrying about math tests, upcoming sports games, or the gossip going around their middle school classrooms, they were almost always talking or running around the house.\nWhile Pam could get used to the high-octane lives of pre-teens, she wasn’t so sure about the financials of all it. Suddenly she had three sets of school supplies to secure, four additional wardrobes to supply (three of them for growing kids), and most pressingly, four additional plates to fill at the table. With her injuries, she wouldn’t be able to return to full-time work. But she knew the part-time job and retirement benefits likely wouldn’t be enough to cover the expenses for this new household of hers all the time.\nPam asked around to see what kind of support other families in the area had found for times like these, and she learned about the Capital Area Food Bank’s free Family Market program, which provides families with fresh fruits, vegetables and non-perishable, healthy groceries each month in their children’s schools. Pam signed up for the market close to the home, and the following month, brought home food that helped her to fill in a week’s worth of meals for her household of five – a major support for the household budget.\n“I think it’s wonderful,” Pam said of the Family Market. “This truly is a blessing.”\nWith more healthy food added into the family’s diet, Pam is seeing a boost in the kids’ energy levels. And without as much financial burden on her, Pam can focus more of her time on ensuring the kids have the resources they need for success.\nFood has also become an important part of their family time; every evening, the family sits down to dinner to discuss their days. And while getting food on the table for a holiday like Thanksgiving might have been a daunting thought before learning about the market, Pam is now looking forward to it, knowing that she’ll have enough to fill the family’s holiday plates.\n“We’ll have apple cinnamon sweet potatoes, beans, rice, string beans and corn,” she said. And she’s particularly excited about cranberry sauce. “I just can’t get enough of it. I’d eat I straight out of the jar!”\nFamily time is always better with food. With a little lift from the Family Markets, Pam can ensure that her father is well taken care of, that the kids are healthy and set up for success, and that the family can celebrate food the way they want to. “Great” aunt indeed.\nThousands of families in our region rely on the food bank’s family markets to help their food budget stretch further each month.Join the movementto support more families.", "image_filenames": ["blo_675.png", "blo_676.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/180622_PartnerSiteCommunitySupportSystems_00018-300x200.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Blog_Pam2.jpg"]}

Several hours from then, this food would be going out to families and kids at a local elementary school through a Joyful Food Market – free, school-based markets in DC’s wards 7 and 8. These markets provide families with lots of fresh produce, which our parents report is often too expensive to purchase in grocery stores or simply not available anywhere nearby.As Dushane and I drove together to Achievement Prep in Ward 8, he talked about the sense of fulfillment he gets from delivering food throughout the region. “It feels good to know that we’re helping people.” Soon, we arrived at the school and unloaded hundreds of pounds of food.Later that afternoon, I joined the team from our partners at Martha’s Table with whom we run the market. We began the work of setting up. Bright red tablecloths, baskets for produce, educational activities, music streaming through a portable speaker. All items that contribute to the unique environment of a Joyful Market. Families have told us that the environment—music, food samples, cooking activities for the kids—gives them a sense of respect, dignity, and fun.We sang as we displayed the colorful produce in the baskets and organized the garbanzo beans, tuna, sea salt grinders, and other items on tables. We were excited, knowing that at 3:45, the real fun was about to begin.As school let out, children and their parents began to come through the line. As they signed in, they received a take-home sheet that contained the market menu as well as recipes and helpful cooking tips. Then, they walked through the line to choose their food. There were tomatoes, onions, lettuce, cucumbers, carrots, oranges, apples, and kiwis. Some kids were hesitant to take kiwis, so we started offering samples as they walked through, and suddenly they were going like hotcakes.That’s the beauty of the market – that ordinary interactions are also opportunities for exploration and education. The little moments where a child chooses to take a kiwi because they got to try it first, or when they take part in a cooking demo, or when a parent sees the recipe for chickpea salad and decides to take those chickpeas after all. In fact, many participating parents report that, after starting to attend the markets, they’ve added more produce to their family’s meals.After a few short hours of noise, music, and activity, the gym we’re in has fallen quiet again. A few produce leaves are strewn on the floor and cleanup is underway. Vegetables and groceries have been packed up and carried off, soon to be turned into meals that will fuel the kids and families who visited today. It’s a scene that’s repeated monthly at each ward 7 and 8 elementary school – every market a new chance for finding the joy in trying something new.\n\nKids enjoying quick bites at our Joyful Food Markets (photos courtesy of Martha’s Table)", "image_filenames": ["blo_680.png", "blo_681.png", "blo_682.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/JFM2-300x200.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/JFM-300x200.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/JFM2.jpg"]}

I think it’s really important for leaders to volunteer side by side with other team members, and we’re fortunate that SAIC believes that too and provides a lot of opportunities to do it.”Wofford’s involvement with hunger relief extends much farther back than his time leading the company’s volunteerism with the Capital Area Food Bank.“When my wife and I were raising our kids,” Wofford said, “we were involved in coaching some of their sports teams. And when you get involved in coaching kids you start to understand that, even in a relatively affluent area, some of them aren’t getting enough to eat. You know from their performance and their energy.”That knowledge prompted the couple to get the whole family involved in volunteering at the North Texas food bank. “It was important for us to show that anyone who was willing and able could make a difference for those less fortunate,” he said.(Those trips volunteering made an impression: his daughter’s first job, following a stint volunteering with AmeriCorps after college, was with that same food bank.)His children are grown now, but as Wofford has travelled extensively for work – in the last few years he’s been to approximately 70 countries and racked up 4 million airline miles – he’s continued to see hunger as a critical issue to tackle, especially in a country and in a region with great overall prosperity. “Knowing how developed we are, and yet to see that we have food insecurity and hunger exist right here – it’s crazy,” he says.Which is why Wofford will continue to raise awareness about hunger by bringing teams to the food bank (and sporting his now-signature orange hair for the occasion).“Coming (to the CAFB),” said Wofford, “especially when someone hasn’t been before, helps them see how much people give, and also how much work it takes to make sure that people get the food they need.”\nTom Wofford (second from right) and SAIC receiving a Corporate Volunteerism award in April", "image_filenames": ["blo_689.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/180428_EveningOfGratitude_00158-e1538429022288.jpg"]}

Running hundreds of them while volunteering and raising awareness about hunger is in a category all its own. Jess Kurti is doing just that.Each year, Jess – a native of Orlando, FL – spends a hefty portion of her free time working on a passion project she’s dubbed “The Beasts of Burden Challenge.” As part of it, she’s made a commitment to donate her time to volunteering at each of the 200+ food banks across the country, while also running as many marathons as possible. She began the project in 2014 and has been all across the US ever since. This past month, she volunteered at the Capital Area Food Bank.When asked about why she wanted to undertake this challenge, Jess said, “I wanted to raise awareness about . . . food banks. I really wanted to get the public engaged locally to end hunger—to get involved in their community.” She went on to explain that she wanted to inspire people to connect with those that they might not have previously interacted with.She also hopes to educate people about issues of food insecurity in the United States, and shares stories from her volunteer experiences and marathon runs on social media. Jess believes that many in country still don’t know how much of an issue hunger is in America. They also might not know exactly what the term “food insecurity” means. She wants to highlight that many people in need aren’t homeless – that they work, but still struggle to stay afloat between the many bills and challenges that come with raising a family.“We have so much food in this country, so people might not know that hunger exists,” Jess says. “And if they do know, they might think it’s too large of a problem for them to tackle. They don’t realize how easy it is to help people if they knew more about the issue and how they could sign up at a local food bank to volunteer or donate. It’s easy to get involved locally and make a difference.”But why run the marathons, too? “Because I really believe in a whole-health approach to ending hunger,” Jess explains. “Feeding people is obviously always a good thing. But it’s not the only part of the solution. Exercise is also needed for mental and physical health, whether you’re a child, adult or senior.”Jess believes that food is closely tied with health and athletic performance. And to her, people are their best selves ready to conquer the challenges of the world when they are physically and mentally fit. Through the Beasts of Burden Challenge, she’s taking action to help her peers understand food insecurity as a whole-health issue, and to inspire others to help their communities become stronger and healthier.", "image_filenames": ["blo_691.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/180830_VolunteerProfile_JessKurti_00003.jpg"]}

Through her work as a pastor with Scripture Whisper Ministries, a faith-based nonprofit that assists at-risk individuals and families, she’s able to extend that helping hand on a regular basis by leading the organization’s food collection and donation activities.Cassandra’s desire to feed others goes back to her childhood, when her family attended summer luncheons at her Baptist church. On those hot summer days, each family in attendance would bring food to share others. “Some of the families didn’t have anything to bring, but they were fed . . . with mouth-watering food,” she reminisces. “There is no feeling like eating and sharing with others!”A decade later, Cassandra – a former Deloitte consultant – had her first volunteer experience with the Capital Area Food Bank, conducting surveys and interviews with families in need as part of an initiative to seek feedback from clients. “During the survey interviews,” she said, “I learned that all persons, whether they are rich or poor, have words of wisdom and a great deal of insight.”The experience stuck with her, and she continued to volunteer as part of the food bank’s nutrition initiatives. Today, Cassandra organizes food drives for the food bank throughout the year. When school rolls around, the organization raises money for food and school supplies for kids in the community. And every Thanksgiving, Scripture Whisper hosts a “Buy One Share One!” Thanksgiving Annual Turkey Drive for families in need, partnering with a local Safeway store so that for every turkey purchased, an extra turkey or non-perishable food item is donated to the food bank.After years of taking action against hunger in one way or another, Cassandra is showing no signs of slowing down any time soon. And she’s quick to note that she wouldn’t have it any other way.\nCassandra’s organization, Scripture Whisper Ministries, conducting its annual Back-to-School drive", "image_filenames": ["blo_692.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/4.jpg"]}

For Hunger Action Month we asked her to share, in her own words, what inspires her to take action.As a government shutdown loomed a few years ago, I tried to figure out what I could do to make a difference. I knew the low wage government employees and contractors would be most quickly and most profoundly impacted by not receiving a pay check while the politics played out.It dawned on me that one thing that I could do was make a contribution to the Capital Area Food Bank to help meet the increased demand CAFB was sure to see in the coming weeks. That’s when my husband and I went from being casual supporters of CAFB who contributed canned goods and wrote an occasional check, to becoming committed, regular donors.That commitment deepened after my mother died, when we decided that we would focus our support to the food bank on senior nutrition in her memory. She and my father had first moved to the Washington metro region over half a century before, and from the time she arrived, she had worked to make life better for older residents in the area who were struggling.\nRobin’s mother and father\nDuring my parents’ first stint in the area in 1955, while my father finished basic training at Ft. Belvoir, my mother got a job working with low income seniors at the Barney Neighborhood House. After a few interceding years moving around the east coast, my parents returned to the DC area in 1966 with my older sister and me in tow, and my mother earned her master’s degree in social work and took a job with a new social service agency, the Jewish Council for the Aging.The agency’s director, Ruth Breslow, had accepted a federal government grant to provide jobs to low income seniors in Montgomery County. A number of more established agencies had turned down the grant, saying there weren’t enough low income seniors in Montgomery County. Ruth and my mother knew better. My mother started that program and oversaw it for almost two decades while she worked at JCA. By the time she left the agency in 1993 as the assistant executive director, she oversaw senior nutrition and housing programs, as well as the employment programs.It is an honor for my husband, my sons, and me to be able to continue my mother’s work. I had the opportunity this summer to join the staff of the food bank for the distribution of groceries to seniors in Montgomery County. I saw that morning the same thing that my mother saw when she launched the senior aide program decades before: that amidst all the affluence in Montgomery County and throughout the DC area, there are seniors who need assistance. Seniors of all races and ethnicities. People in good health and people living with disabilities. Immigrants, and people born in the US. These seniors have raised their children and cared for their parents, worked hard and built our community. And today, some of them need our support to make sure they can eat good, nutritious food.The Capital Area Food Bank’s senior nutrition programs make an enormous difference in the lives of many seniors, and my family feels fortunate to be able to do our part to sustain these vital programs.\nRobin walking with her mother and son", "image_filenames": ["blo_693.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Robin-Shaffert-2.jpg"]}

Throughout Hunger Action month, we will tell the story of volunteers, donors, and food donors who take action to join the cause of taking hunger off the map!Joseph Schroeder is a Kansas native and an associate at the DC law firm of Kirkland & Ellis. For the past two years, he’s also been a monthly donor to the Capital Area Food Bank.Joseph loves Kansas City BBQ and the occasional sugary snack. “I have a sweet tooth,” he confesses. But over the last few years, he’s grown a little more health conscious. “I’ve tried to focus more on my diet and what I eat”, he notes, and laughs as he says he’s found that vegetables can actually taste good. He’s noticed, though, that nutritious food is often higher priced—especially fresh fruits and vegetables. He also realizes that good food isn’t easy for everyone to access.“If people don’t have a car, and have to work multiple jobs, they don’t have the time or the ability to walk 30 minutes to a grocery store to find fresh produce. And, even if they can get there, fresh produce is…expensive. It’s something we don’t always think about,” Joseph said. “If I can make the situation better . . . then that’s worth the small sacrifice of money out of a paycheck each month.”Joseph’s monthly donations aren’t motivated solely by his awareness of the increased cost of healthier food. He wants to help others because he feels that it’s simply the right thing to do. He grew up in a faith tradition, he shares, and in his view, one of the best parts of that experience was being taught to care about other people as “brothers and sisters”, not as strangers.He also knows what a toll hunger takes on his own ability to be productive. “When I’m hungry, my focus will go down. If I’m writing a brief that is difficult and I’m hungry, then at some point I’ll be forced to stop and get food because my brain simply won’t be able to handle it any more. If I try and go to sleep hungry, I simply won’t be able to fall asleep. For me, it just seems like an inconvenience, but for those dealing with food insecurity it must seem like this constant source of oppression.”What moves Joseph the most is when he thinks about children who go hungry. “I was lucky,” he says. “But if the same me had been born into different (circumstances), my life could be so different. And it wouldn’t be my fault or anything I did, and it’s not those kids’ fault either.”Everyone can be a little part of the solution, Joseph notes, in helping children and in making sure struggling families won’t have to decide between paying for medicine or rent and paying for food.“I see people who are struggling every day,” Joseph remarked, describing his walk to work each morning. “It’s easy to think, ‘Oh gosh, this is a problem—someone should do something about this! The government should do something about this!’ And while I think that may be true, we also have the ability to do something…ourselves.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_694.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Joseph-Scroeder.jpg"]}

After completing the eight-week course, four staff members were dubbed Certified Beekeepers in the District, and assigned a mentor to help with upkeep of the apiary in the CAFB Urban Demonstration Garden.We have three hives and about 30,000 bees that are nearing the end of their foraging season. Bee winter, or dearth, starts in September/October in the DC region when blooms are decreasing and there is less pollen to be had. While they are collecting the last of the pollen and nectar in the area, they are also managing their growing population and trying to stay cool like everyone else!Bee education is an essential part of the learning experience in our Urban Garden Demonstration. Much of the food we eat can be traced back to bees. They’ve either pollinated the fruits and vegetables we eat directly, or pollinated the food for the animals that we then consume. It’s important to understand the role bees play in the process so we can safeguard bees, cultivate more food, and ultimately feed more people.\nApiary (n):a place where bees are kept; a collection of beehives.Example sentence:The CAFB has an apiary in our backyard in the Urban Demonstration Garden!Royal Jelly (n):a substance created by nurse honeybee workers to feed all new eggs and larvae that are being raised as potential queen bees.Example sentence:If you find a queen cell with royal jelly in it, you might want to examine the hive further to make sure your bees aren’t about to swarm!Bearding (v):when bees are assembled on the outside of the hive during hot weather. They may cling to the outside of the brood boxes, hang from the alighting board, or gather near the entrance in a triangle, or beard shape. The purpose of bearding is to manage the temperature of the hive by assembling a small group of adult bees and beating their wings to push fresh air into the hive.", "image_filenames": ["blo_698.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/180820_BeeKeepingProgram_00025.jpg"]}

They were all hustle, too. In just under a few hours, the team of around 90 people had packed over 7,500 bags of groceries for people throughout the Washington metro area who are food insecure.They had also tended to the soil in large swaths of the food bank’s Urban Demonstration garden.And this came after the team had, not long before at their own offices, packed 1,000 bags of weekend food for kids and families.When kicking off Nestlé Cares day earlier that morning, CEO and Market Head of Nestlé USA Steve Presley spoke about the importance of service, and it’s a value that employees clearly share.“Being with a company that gives not only money but man hours is really important to me,” said Ben Schuh, with the company’s beverage division. “Nestlé is putting both its money and its people where its mouth is.”Monica Stachowski, who works in procurement, agrees, and observed that getting into the community was proving to be a great way to connect with co-workers. “I know this will help us get to know each other, put faces to names, and build that spirit that we all have,” she said. “Today’s been absolutely fantastic – you can tell that a lot of love is going to families in need today.”If Nestlé employees are passionate about volunteerism, they might be even more passionate about the transformative power of a meal.Delphine Cordie, who works on the beverage marketing team, shared not only her enthusiasm about the event (“We’re focused on making an impact everywhere, and I love that philosophy!”), but also about the broader importance of having enough to eat. “Eating engages all of you – there’s no other experience like it,” she said, while recounting fond memories of meals with her grandmother. “Food unlocks performance. If you have dreams – and everyone does – then you need food.”Ben Schuh shared a similar sentiment. “Pretty much all of the happiest moments in your life have food in them, or are celebrated with food. Giving that feeling to other people is amazing. If we can give even a little of that joy today, it’s worth it.”With people this fired up about food and helping others, it’s no wonder that they made big things happen in such a short period of time. And with continued partnership between the region’s largest hunger relief organization and one of the world’s largest food companies, there’s no telling what’s possible.", "image_filenames": ["blo_701.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSF6804.jpg"]}

Instead of darting around the playground or taking a dive in the local swimming pool, kids feel the growl of an empty stomach.Summer is the hungriest time of the year.Nearly 200,000 children are at risk of hunger in the Washington D.C. metro area, and their food insecurity is heightened during the summer months. During the school year, these kids may have access to free or reduced-price breakfasts and lunches, but those meals go away during the summer. Research shows that family grocery costs can rise more than $300 a month when school is out and kids are home. This forces many families to make hard choices between paying for food and paying to keep the lights on or to pay for health care. This leads to hunger and anxiety for families, and for children in particular.Summer hunger has long-term consequences. Without proper nutrition during the warm summer months, kids are more likely to experience “summer slide,” forgetting much of what they’ve learned during the school year. This puts them at a disadvantage as they start the next year.That’s why it’s essential to connect kids with the good food they need to thrive throughout the summer.Run in partnership with recreation centers and many of the same locations that provide after-school meals during the school year, the food bank’s 58 Summer Meals locations offer children a place to play, learn, and eat healthy meals and snacks during the summer days.And for kids who can’t make it to a summer meals location, we operate the CAFB Mobile Meals Bus. Now in its fourth year, the bus brings healthy lunches to children living in high need areas on the Route 9 corridor that are cut off from traditional brick and mortar locations by a highway.Access to daily summer meals helps kids feel full and energized, so they can be ready for summer adventures, and spend summer the way it was meant to be.You can join us in the fight against summer hunger!", "image_filenames": ["blo_702.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Option-9-1.jpg"]}

A couple of blocks from NPR, adjacent to shiny new condos/apartment buildings, but also adjacent to a street with boarded up houses. You could hear the sounds of construction a few blocks away. What an apt reflection of DC today.It was an amazing sight to see people of all cultures, standing in line as early as 5 am, with people chaining their shopping carts to the railing on the side of the street. The lines wrapped around two, maybe even three city blocks before the market opened.As I walked through the line I saw a true reflection of this global city: Chinese women doing their morning stretches; Chinese men sitting down playing a card game; a woman of Middle Eastern descent with a head scarf tending to her baby; an African American woman in her wheel chair waiting with her bag perched on her lap; and members of a church on the street handing out some water and allowing those in line to use their restroom.Back at the market, volunteers were putting up tents, standing up tables, starting to take onions from a 50 pound bag and dividing them into smaller containers. Our CAFB driver James was moving bottles of almond milk from the truck on a fork lift, registration forms were being lined up, and menu cards were being stacked. There was a steady stream of work and chit chat among volunteers as we worked and swayed our hips a bit to the Motown music that was blaring from our boom box on the sidewalk.Gabbi, the market leader from the food bank, brought all the volunteers together to explain how things would work and how much we would be allocating per family: two boxes of cereal; one carton of milk; three to four heads of cabbage; one carton of kale; a bag each of onions and potatoes. We all went to our stations, and soon we were open for business.The snaking line of people began to move, and soon the bags and carts of our international patrons were being filled with food. I was moved by the number of people who said, “thank you – this really helps”, or who happily engaged in conversation about what recipe they planned to use a particular vegetable in. Some shared what the extra produce was helping them to achieve with their health.It also made me wonder, though – even as I observed how critical this market is for so many – how could we be doing more to make this snaking line shorter? What would it take to both meet our visitors’ need for food today, and help them move towards a future where our services don’t have to be a part of their monthly planning? And, importantly, could food play a role in both of these scenarios?If this situation, in the shadow of the Capitol, is to be addressed once and for all, it’s going to take all of us, along with new, creative ideas that involve time, technology, training, trust, and resources.Time, to develop new ideas and partnerships, and to build the economic bridges that enable people to move from reliance on food that is free, to food that is subsidized, to participating as traditional consumers in the marketplace.Technology, both existing and new, to continue improving our understanding of where and what kind of resources are needed to best serve our communities.Training, done in partnership with others, to build skills that can drive economic advancement for the people we serve and create lasting food security.Trust, between and among the food bank, those we serve, our nonprofit partners, and the many individuals and sectors engaged in the work of ending hunger as we try new approaches to solving old problems.And resources, to invest in this critical work and drive outcomes – children who can better focus in school; a stronger, healthier adult workforce; seniors aging with dignity, among many others – that benefit every member of our region and our broader society.Shortening the line at the market, even as we work to ensure that those who are in it today get enough of the best food possible, will not be easy. And it will not be quick. But it is achievable, and it is the work that we are committed to because it is the work that the future demands. We are not alone on this journey, and welcome all who will join us as we continue onward.Together we can solve hunger.", "image_filenames": ["blo_706.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Radha-in-Line-1.jpg"]}

Hannah runs the weekly food pantry at Faith United Methodist Church, which receives food from the Capital Area Food Bank through an organization called Community Support Systems Inc.It’s a rainy Friday in Accokeek, Maryland and 50-60 families have braved the weather to come through the Pantry. They come to gain access to a variety of nutritious, healthy food. Hannah says that Community Support Systems prides itself on choice—the ability for guests to choose what foods they want, rather than receiving a pre-packaged bag.“The way it’s set up, they go around just like they are in a grocery store. It’s more personal here and the guests appreciate it.”Guests like Roslee Y., a 56-year-old mother who supports three children living under her roof—a young daughter and two grandchildren. A few years ago, Roslee suffered a physical setback and was paralyzed for six months. Though she recovered enough to walk again, she remains on disability and is unable to work. With disability benefits as the only source of income for her family, Roslee often has to make difficult sacrifices: sometimes paying for food means not paying a household bill.But Roslee recently found the Food Pantry and continues to attend because it helps her make sure her children grow up strong and healthy, and because of the dignity she is afforded. Roslee loves that the Food Pantry provides her with choice—something that is especially necessary for her because she can’t eat foods high in Vitamin K due to a blood disease she battles.Another client, Roy G., was recently laid off from his job due to a disability. While he would love to continue working, he too has had many physical setbacks that make finding work difficult. The support he receives from the Food Pantry is crucial for him to maintain both his health, and that of his 80-year-old neighbor with Alzheimer’s, whom he helps care for.Roslee, Roy and the other guests make their way through the Food Pantry over the course of a two-hour time span. They choose from an assortment of vegetables, fruits, breads, pasta, grains and more, and leave with food to see them through much of the month ahead—a fact that makes Hannah quite proud.“We divvy up all our food to make sure there will be the same amount for everyone,” she says. “Everyone leaves here with an equitable amount of food.”To Hannah, that equity–and the experience of choosing one’s own food—is what it’s all about when offering dignity to a community in need.\n", "image_filenames": ["blo_708.png", "blo_709.png", "blo_710.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/180622_PartnerSiteCommunitySupportSystems_00019-300x200.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/180622_PartnerSiteCommunitySupportSystems_00013-300x200.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/180622_PartnerSiteCommunitySupportSystems_00003.jpg"]}

Earlier this year, while visiting our partner New Samaritan Baptist Church’s weekly distribution of fruits, vegetables, and groceries, we got a chance to talk with Richard Adams. He’s in his 70s and spent 27 years in the U.S. Army before spending 27 more working in public service.\nHis favorite part about retirement is sleeping in, which he does every day of the week except for one: Thursdays, when he drives the truck to make the weekly pickup from the Capital Area Food Bank.\nOn those early mornings, he shared, he’s rarely excited to wake up.\n\n“But,” he told me, “then I think about all the people who need food. Especially the veterans we serve who need food. And it gets me up. It gets me out of bed and into that truck.”\nThe urge to make sure that families – and veterans less fortunate than he is – get food each week has been motivating him to drive that truck without fail for many years now.\nHunger doesn’t discriminate – even against those who have proudly worn a uniform for their country. We’re thankful for volunteers like Richard, and partners like New Samaritan, who are devoted to serving those who have served for all of us.", "image_filenames": ["blo_721.png", "blo_722.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/US-Army-Veteran-and-Volunteer-Richard-Adams-with-Site-Leader-Denise-Clyburn-e1513977541669.jpg", "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/US-Army-Veteran-and-Volunteer-Richard-Adams-with-Site-Leader-Denise-Clyburn-e1513977541669.jpg"]}

Read on to learn more about our most recent Corporate and Foundation Champions!\nEach of the supporters who joined us for the 15th Annual Blue Jeans Ball made the evening a success by helping to raise the funds for more than 1 million meals for our neighbors in need.Giant Food, as the presenting sponsor, enabled the evening’s impact to reach new heights by both making a significant investment in the evening’s success, and reaching out to its network to bring in a new and incredible group of supporters.MGM National Harborhosted the Blue Jeans Ball’s VIP Reception, which featured signature appetizers prepared by MGM’s executive chef, Jason Johnson and specialty drinks from their cocktail lounge, Blossom.\nTheGiant Family Foundationshowed its continued support of the food bank’s childhood feeding programs through a generous donation will provide over 800,000 meals to children in the Washington Metro area. The grant will support a variety of programs providing healthy, high-quality food to children in need.Additionally, theTarget Foundationhas renewed its commitment to getting good food into the hands of children and families. Target presented the food bank with a gift that will provide over 30,000 meals, ensuring that more kids and families will have access to the fruits, vegetables, and other foods they need to thrive.\nTheSafeway Foundationrecently partnered with ABC 7 and DC United for the Kick Hunger Challenge. Throughout the month-long campaign, Safeway gave customers the option to add a donation to the food bank to their total at checkout. Customers responded in a big way, and in total, the campaign raised the funds for 442,500 meals!Seven localJersey Mike’s Subslocations chose to dedicate their March “Month of Giving” to the Capital Area Food Bank.

When her shift ends at 10 AM, she grabs a few hours of sleep before running errands for her family. Then it’s time to head back over to pick up Kenny.Arisai is working hard, but the earnings from her job don’t always enable her to purchase the kinds of food she’d like to for her son, which can be expensive. That’s why she’s glad that Kenny’s after care program, Jubilee HeadStart, partners with the Capital Area Food Bank as one of its 2,000 After-School and Summer Meals sites.“The support means a lot,” Arisai said recently when speaking about the food at Jubilee. Fresh fruit and yogurt are among the snacks that Kenny and the other members of his aftercare class eat each day when they tumble in – snacks that sustain them as teacher Audrey Walker leads them through an afternoon filled with STEM projects, art, and play time. And before heading out each night, each child receives dinner.“It makes me feel good to know that they’ve had a good meal before leaving” said Walker during a recent conversation, “since I know some of them may not have dinner waiting at home.”Arisai is just one of the many parents who relies on the help of an after-care program to provide both a nurturing place for her child to learn and play, and good food for him to eat. This support is even more important during the summer months, when free or reduced-price breakfast and lunch aren’t available. Jubilee is a Summer Meals partner, so Kenny continues to get the good food he needs even while school is out of session.Nearly 200,000 children and teens are at risk of hunger in the Washington, DC metro area. But with access to healthy after school and summer meals for their children, thousands of parents like Arisai have peace of mind knowing that their kids will have meals to fuel their learning and growth throughout the year.If you’d like to help kids and families like Arisai and Kenny, consider making a donation to our Summer Meals Campaign today!", "image_filenames": ["blo_724.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Arisai.jpg"]}

Collectively, they save the organization roughly 2.5 million dollars in labor costs every year —enough to provide over 6 million meals to the community through our partners.We’re always on the lookout for ways to say “thank you”, and April – National Volunteer Month – presented a great opportunity to do that with an “Evening of Gratitude.”Recognized during the event were some of the incredible organizations and individuals who have gone “above and beyond” in their service over the year:Our Corporate Service Award went to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) to honor the dozens of volunteer hours their staff has provided us as well as the thousands of meals SAIC has provided through their monetary contributions. Tom Wofford, SAIC’s senior vice president, accepted the award on behalf of the company.Erika Orina was honored with a Volunteer Award for her dedication to our Urban Garden. Volunteering twice a week for the last year, Erika has become a cornerstone of the garden. She has often taught new volunteers about gardening and even helped mend damages to the garden after major storms.Additional awards went out to District of Columbia Courts, the Georgetown Day School, and individuals Rob Schulman and Karen Baldi.“Don’t ever doubt,” said President and CEO Radha Muthiah while presenting awards, “that that extra hour, that extra donation makes a huge difference in someone’s life.”We simply couldn’t do our work without the help of our volunteers.

Attendees sampled recipes prepared by Giant nutritionists from theCAFB recipe cards; participated in breathing exercises; and shared their own experiences with stress and working with those with stress related diseases.\nGiant Food in-store nutritionists Leslie Jefferson and Roxana Eshani begin a cooking demonstration for CAFB partners\n“We were happy with the vibe,” said Katherine Donnelly, Education Specialist at the Capital Area Food Bank. “ConnectEd is a great way to create a sharing, learning environment for our partners.”CAFB partners shared some of the myriad issues in the communities they serve with the panelists during the interactive session. Panelists taught partners how to access shareable, health resources from the American Heart Association website and informed them about nutritionists available at Giant stores that can help customers shop for heart healthy products.

It’s cheaper than do-it-yourself dinners, isn’t it?”Not exactly.So where do the key cost savings come from with DIY dinners? It’s all in the LEFTOVERS.There are two types of leftovers to be enjoyed from preparing DIY dinners:meal leftoversandstaple leftovers.\nTake our recipe of the month,Sweet Potato and Black Bean Soft Tacos. A lot of black bean and sweet potato filling came from that recipe. After enjoying the filling wrapped in a tortilla for dinner and lunch the next day, here are more ways to transform your leftover taco filling:\nStaples are ingredients with possibility. And when we have leftover staples that’s less money spent on the next grocery trip. Leftovers from our our Sweet Potato and Black Bean Soft Tacos give us staples that, if left to the imagination, can make some tasty bites.\nTo waste less and save on your next grocery trip, try these staple leftovers as:Baked Nachos: Cut flour tortillas into wedges, toast in the oven 5 minutes at 400 degrees, sprinkle with cheese and chili powder for 5 more minutes or until crispy. Enjoy with smashed avocado and salsa mixed together).Tortilla Pizza: Top flour tortillas with tomato paste and cheese. Bake at 400 degrees 10 minutes or until browned and bubbly. Frozen veggies like corn are a healthy topping addition.Breakfast Tacos: Scramble an egg and add salsa and chili powder at the end. Fill flour tortillas and enjoy with sliced avocado.Remember, using up meal and staple leftovers is key to getting bang for your buck; helps cut food waste in the kitchen; and helps trim food costs at the grocery store.

And just as we root for tasty sweet potato ideas because they are a key staple at the food bank, we suspect that one or two leftovers may be rolling around in your own cupboards as relics from the holiday season.We hold this low cost high flavor taco near and dear because it’s:\nSweet potatoes, black beans, onions and chili powder. Pretty basic stuff. We have faith in staples because with a little imagination, so many meals can be made. If one of these key ingredients are missing on the shelves, they can easily be swapped for another type of bean or potato, or purchased at the store at a reasonable price.\nThe add-on possibilities are endless here. Cheese, avocado, a fried egg, salsa, slaw. The sky’s the limit to what you can add on top.\nAllowing kids to choose how they will fill their taco is a friendly invitation to try new things; and assembling a meal themselves equals happy little hands and happy little bellies.\nOnions about to go bad? Sweet potato spots resembling craters on the moon? No problem. It will all taste just the same chopped up and cooked with spices.\nChili powder is the key warming spice. You can also add a pop of fresh flavor with chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice for a lively lift.\nThis comes together in 30 minutes. If the weeknights require food that is faster, prepare the filling over the weekend and then the tacos are ready for assembly at a moments notice.\nSwap out potato for sweet potato, brown lentils for the black beans, and curry powder for the spice and you have an Indian inspired doppelganger of this recipe.

Cheerful chatter fills the space, and at the center of the activity – saying hello, checking progress, smiling at everyone – is Denise Clyburn. She greets with hugs – handshakes are “not her thing”.\nWith the help of many diligent assistants, Denise runs the church’s weekly fresh food distribution, as well as its pantry across the street.\nSoon, people are getting called up to fill their bags with produce and groceries. “If you’re over 90, you go first!” calls out Henry Thomas, one of the program’s regular volunteers. More than a few people are in this category, and after them flow people of all ages.\n“I just want to meet people’s needs,” says Clyburn, when asked about what has motivated her to do this work as a volunteer for the past many years. “We have all kinds of people that come here for food. Young, old. Lots of families.” She references a rambunctious little girl who is here with her mother. “I’ve known her since she was an infant.”\n“I want to help families with growing kids bridge that monthly gap between what they have and what they need. Same for our seniors who come. This food helps do that, and it makes my heart happy when people say what the food means to them.”\nLow wages and unemployment are the biggest challenge that most of the guests face, says Clyburn, noting that hunger is almost never obvious.  In the case of seniors, Clyburn shares, fixed incomes don’t stretch far enough. “I’ve seen the need first hand over the years,” she says.\nLater, in a house across the street, Denise tours us through the church’s Agape Pantry. “It’s my baby”, says Clyburn, as she proudly points out children’s clothing and school supplies; men’s ties; women’s shoes; and the pantry that now takes up the whole of the basement, with low sodium vegetables on shelves and a freezer full of turkeys.\n“We’ve been able to grow all of this because of the Capital Area Food Bank,” she added. “We used to have all of this on just one floor, but with the abundance we receive from the food bank, we moved the clothes upstairs and expanded the food.”\nClyburn says she dreams of taking over the whole house for the pantry. While she wishes the need didn’t exist, she’s also glad to be able to help those who are struggling. “We’ve built a real community here,” she says. “It’s based on dignity and respect”.\nFor Clyburn, that speaks to the heart of the food distribution, and the pantry. “Humanity is what matters,” she says. “That’s why we do this”.", "image_filenames": ["blo_756.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DeniseClyburn_Blog-header3.jpg"]}

She couldn’t travel far for food, and our neighborhood didn’t have many choices. When she shopped at the stores wewereable to get to, my mother didn’t always choose things that were good for her health, because she didn’t know much about nutrition and its role in her diabetes management and overall health.  There was no one to share that information with her, and she didn’t have sufficient access to the food that would have helped her anyway.My mom’s story isn’t uncommon. For too many people East of the River, in fact, it rings true everyday.In DC’s Wards 7 and 8, options for fresh affordable food are scarce: there are only 3 full service grocery stores for the over 150,000 people who live there.  It’s too difficult for many residents– especially the 47% who have no access to a personal vehicle and the 17% who have a disability– to get to fresh, healthy food. Those who can get to a grocery store often face long lines, limited item selection, and a lack of quality meat and produce options.  This has direct impacts on people’s health: the highest rates of obesity and chronic disease are among those living East of the River. Residents are dramatically more likely to die from chronic diet-related disease.In honor of my mother, and those like her, I walked alongside hundreds of other people from throughout our region on a recent Saturday at the first ever Grocery Walk, to raise our voices and show our common commitment to ending the food injustice in Wards 7 and 8. As a proud employee of the Capital Area Food bank, which co-sponsored the walk, I marched the two miles to downtown Anacostia from the nearest grocery store – over 2 miles away. It’s a short walk for those out in the air of a pleasant afternoon. It’s a lifetime away for someone who is carrying many days’ worth of groceries. Or has young children. Or is disabled. Or is elderly. And on and on.Good food is essential to a good, healthy life, and your zip code shouldn’t determine your health.Access to healthy food shouldn’t be a luxury – it a human right.But until it is true in our area that all people have adequate access to good, healthy food, we will continue working – and marching.", "image_filenames": ["blo_758.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/grocery-walk-crowd.jpg"]}

The vegetables, beans, grains and other ingredients that the CAFB makes available serve as the “tools” with which students practice their knife cuts, sautéing techniques, and other culinary skills while preparing meals for those in need.In La Cocina VA’s bilingual program, 9 students from Spanish-speaking countries receive the important training they’ll need to work as restaurant chefs by preparing meals with high nutritional value for other area nonprofits serving low-income families and the homeless. Food safety certification, nutrition lessons, and more are also provided to students over the 13 weeks before graduation.Maribel, who came to the US from Honduras, was jobless and feeling lost when she discovered the power that food could have in shaping her future.  “One day it occurred to me, it was time to do something different, get back to work. So I sat down with a friend of mine and said . . . ‘Help me figure out what to do.’”Today, Maribel is a student at La Cocina, where she’s creating new opportunities for herself and enabling healthier lives for others. The nutritious meals that she and other students cook are paired with one of theCAFB’s bilingual recipes, and distributed to the thousands of neighbors across Northern Virginia who need them. La Cocina VA is one of 100 CAFB food assistance partners in Virginia providing balanced meals for over 133,000 residents struggling with hunger in that region.\nBeing part of something bigger makes it easy for Maribel to report for class every day. “When we send the food [to people], it’s like sending it to our family,” says Maribel. “I know we’re not sending something we’re not going to eat. It has to have vegetables–today we have carrots, beans, chicken, and caramelized onions. Just a little tiny bit makes a difference in the flavors.”Because of the nutritious food from the CAFB, thousands of people receive life changing meals through LA Cocina.  And because La Cocina can invest in its programming and students rather than paying for food, its job training program offers brighter futures for students like Maribel.Psst!

Both new research and recent disruption in the private sector market have set up a host of new opportunities with the promise to upend not only the retail industry, but also some of the access challenges plaguing low income communities in need of more – and better – food options.Surely you’ve heard that Amazon scooped up Whole Foods, setting up potential for new and different grocery delivery.Then Nestle sold off its candy division in a play to shift the company’s work and reputation toward its healthier offerings.Now theNew Food Economyreports that consuming more fruits and vegetables is the leading path to reducing heart disease, according to a new study by Tufts University.We’ve always known that eating our vegetables was good for us. We now know it’s likely that a 10 percent subsidy for fruits and vegetables “would result in more than 150,000 prevented or postponed” deaths due to cardiovascular disease by 2030.The disruption in the private-sector market, coupled with both mounting market demand for healthier food options and new research on the power of produce, sets up a world of possibility – and a world of responsibility. We now have the burden of knowledge, and it falls on the shoulders of many.Food banks must increase distribution of produce and other health-sustaining foods, and continue to forge partnerships with the private sector on delivery and other access models.And private sector companies must recognize the pivotal role they can and must play in the health of low income America by stepping up and step into the food desert breech.Rarely has the opportunity to bring new solutions to the old problem of hunger been so clear.

Roman•March 31, 2017\nIn what seems to be a never ending debate on national health care, there is one fact that both the left and the right agree on: Americans spend the majority of our dollars on end-of-life crisis care and very little on prevention.Inthis morning’s Washington Post, Fareed Zakaria argues that the free market – of which he is a big champion – mis-serves us when it comes to health care. He draws on the work of Nobel-prize winning economist Kenneth Arrow, who said that market forces fail in the area of health care because of “a huge mismatch of power and information between the buyer and the seller.” You can easily walk away from a car salesman’s pitch and buy another kind of car, for example, or choose simply not to buy a consumer good like a hairbrush. But if a doctor insists that you need a procedure or medication, you are unlikely to reject the advice.My point here is not to advocate for national healthcare (though I’m not entirely sure it is a bad idea), but rather to provide context for and drill into my earlier statement. In this country, it has been hard to make a shift from pouring calories into extending the last few months of life to instead better using our earlier years well to build a long life free of diabetes and heart disease.As the head of a food bank, I daily witness the power of food – not just to fill a stomach, but to over time tackle the troika of diet related disease that plagues the low income community: diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Eating better and smarter is both an obvious and inexpensive means to prevent these diseases. And yet I have marveled that there isn’t more interest among hospitals and other health providers in partnering with us to do this preventative work. In this vein, Zakaria noted something that struck me anew:“The problem with the free market is that there is little profit in prevention and lots in crisis care,” he wrote.That may explain why the Capital Area Food Bank, which is providing food to 12 percent of the Washington metro area’s population and doing so in a way that boosts health and gives people knowledge about how to use food against diabetes and heart disease, has had no fewer than three dozen conversations with medical leaders that have all started off as promising but ultimately fizzled out. Health care providers know we need to do more prevention, but the lack of evident short-term profit may be the road block. This apparent myopia undercuts progress, as embracing longer term solutions like better eating habits will bring down not only the prevalence but also the cost of treatment of these diseases.That’s one of the reasons that we are hosting a health care summit on May 18, bringing medical professionals together for a half-day session to discuss the powerful link between food and the two most expensive diet related diseases – diabetes and heart disease – and how to break down barriers so that we can do some of the obvious and necessary preventative work for low income communities.One of these days, more people will see that the tools to slow the rate of onset of diet-related disease, both for the low income community and for wider society, have been right in front of us. We know what to do. We know how to do it. We just have to get serious about recognizing food as the best medicine, and in providing sustainable access to it.", "image_filenames": ["blo_773.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/fruit-veg-stethescope-photo.jpg"]}

Roman•January 19, 2017\nToday, about 40 percent of the world’s population lives in cities. By 2050, the number of people living in cities will climb to 70 percent. This swift urbanization of hunger and poverty has had real consequences outside of urban centers too, moving just outside of cities as housing and other costs rise in city centers. This has certainly been the case in our very own Washington suburbs.Take Prince Georges County, where rates of food insecurity among residents have hit near-emergency levels: 15.5 percent, as contrasted with DC where, even in a high-need urban center, rates are fully two percentage points lower. Food insecurity increased in 216 census tracts across the Washington metro area from 2014 – 2016, and of those, 45% are in Prince George’s County.Elizabeth Kneebone, a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings and co-author of Confronting Suburban Poverty in America says the geography of poverty and opportunity has changed. From 2000 to 2011, the poor population in the suburbs grew by 64 percent—more than twice the 29 percent growth in cities.That’s a whopping change – we see it in bright red on ourHunger Heat Map. And it’s also a call to action. As we direct our resources to areas of greatest need in urban areas, we are also stepping up our work in suburban communities to tackle the areas where there are deep pockets of hunger, and strengthening the overall food safety net.What does this look like?In Prince George’s County, the food bank is making an investment of $3 million this yearwith the goal of dramatically improving long-overdue access to food and programming for children, seniors, and families.

The company recently surprised the Capital Area Food Bank with a $150,000 gift in support of its efforts to eliminate junk food from its inventory, embrace health and wellness, and transform food banking while addressing food insecurity.“We wanted to support hunger, and this is an organization that is doing it with courage and improving the health and wellness for the people they’re reaching,” said Michelle Bosch, Vice President and General Manager of Enterprise in Washington DC.The donation is part of a program – called Fill Your Tank – that celebrates Enterprise Rent-A-Car’s 60th anniversary by providing $60 million over six years to fight hunger around the globe.

This donation will support people who need a little help to reach to their full potential.”The food bank is thankful to Enterprise and its employees for helping hundreds of thousands of meals reach children, seniors, and families in the region!", "image_filenames": ["blo_776.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSC7273.jpg"]}

And the more I learned about hunger in this area as I worked with the CAFB, the more important it felt to support the food bank’s work financially.Food wasn’t always on my radar as a charitable giving priority, probably because it had always been available to me.  But as I discovered the pervasiveness of hunger in this affluent region – the sheer number of children, minimum-wage workers, low-income seniors, and others without access to good food on a regular basis – I was stunned. I felt I had to do something to help slash this number.I want to be part of the solution in the fight against hunger. By giving to the food bank, I know that I am. And thanks to the food bank’s notably low fundraising expenses and overhead costs, I also know that almost all of the money I give will go directly to initiatives that help get food to kids, families, and seniors.By giving generously this holiday season, we can all make a big difference.As a matter of fact, 12 friends of the food bank have also signed up to match any gift made before the clock strikes midnight tonight, up to $100,000.Will you join me in providing kids and families with the meals they need?I hope so.

She believed that by providing nutritious food, her family would stay well and not have to visit the doctor as frequently. So she started to explore creative food sourcing strategies.After learning that many grocery stores donate products close to expired dates to churches and other non-profits, Ester worked with her church to be able to collect food from local grocery stores that was past peak freshness but still healthy and good to eat. Soon, Esther and her family were picking up surplus food from area grocery stores on a weekly basis.Over time, Esther started collecting more food than her family could use. In an effort not to waste anything, the family often stopped at parks while driving back home to Maryland to share food with some of Washington’s homeless residents.

Roman•October 3, 2016\nTom Wilson is right.The chairman and chief executive of Allstate has called on corporations to “be a force for good in society.”Those of us with a more direct line to doing good should flesh out what that means.While I’ve never bought into the notion that big business is evil, most companies are only scratching the surface of what they could do to solve the challenges we face as a society.When many hear this, they think about paying a living wage or providing good health coverage. And those things absolutely matter. But many companies also have the power to bite off a particular problem and work to solve it.A good example of a company that’s doing just this is Giant Food, a subsidiary of Ahold. A 36-year partner of the Capital Area Food Bank, Giant had long been supporting us in the same fashion that many good companies began to back in the 70s – with checks and food. And don’t get me wrong: this kind of support is still needed and appreciated. What is happening now, however, is important because it significantly increases the odds of making a fundamental change possible.Under the leadership of Gordon Reid, Giant is piloting the use ofCapital Area Food Bank recipesthat break down barriers to fresh food. Giant sees, as we do, that sometimes it isn’t that a single mom with three kids isn’t willing or able to buy kale – she just isn’t sure how to prepare it, what it will taste like, or how long it will take. And when resources are precious, taking a risk on an unfamiliar vegetable isn’t one that many families feel they can afford.So our recipes, put within reach by Giant, spell out how to use produce in a way that feeds 4 people for less than $7, often in just a few minutes. It’s a great alternative to fast food.Maybe even more important, Giant and Shoppers Food warehouse are two bold retailers who have acknowledged that too many processed carbohydrates with added sugars are finding their way onto the tables of low-income families. As higher income families eat better and opt for fewer of these high margin, high carbohydrate foods, they can sometimes be donated at a volume that doesn’t make sense for Food Banks committed to providing a balanced offering of protein, fruits, and vegetables (along with, yes, an occasional treat).Shoppers Food Warehouse was first to heed the call to sort out bakery items (cakes and pies) from its donations. Now, Giant is going a step further, working to sort out even more items like leftover holiday candy. Both retail chains have stepped up the nutritional levels of the boxes of food they create for people to buy and donate at the register.\n", "image_filenames": ["blo_796.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/capitalareafoodbank_31551393_Full.jpg"]}

Roman•September 14, 2016\nWhile my garden thrives with tomatoes, kale, cucumbers, broccoli, zucchini, peppers, and more over the course of a gardening season, I am known as a killer of melons. I have never managed to bring one to fruit, though certainly not for lack of trying.The vine often takes off, and usually even flowers.But when the small sweet fuzzies that are supposed to eventually turn into fruit begin to appear, they invariably either rot, are pecked by a bird, or just give up the ghost for no apparent reason.So when Amanda Marino, who oversees the Capital Area Food Bank’sUrban Demonstration Garden, approached with a little cantaloupe seedling and a big smile, I didn’t have the heart to tell her that I would likely kill it. I thanked her, took it, and tucked it into a patch of the red-clay dirt of my garden between a rose and tomato plant. I surrounded it with a bit of compost and hoped for the best. That was in early July.I watered it as I watered the other plants, and tried not to get emotionally attached when those first little fuzzies appeared. By the end of the month, the fuzz had dropped and it actually looked like a small fruit, but still, I kept my emotional distance. When I left for a vacation Aug. 2, though, it was hard not to have hope…I was delighted when my daughter, who returned home before me, texted a picture: “Mom, what is this green thing?”Then the worry became: when to pick the precious fruit? I watched a video online. I talked to Amanda, who said to look for crisping tendrils. I fretted.Finally, on Saturday, I plucked it. And it was delicious!And there are more!A small garden miracle that started from one tiny Capital Area Food Bank seedling.", "image_filenames": ["blo_797.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cant3.jpg"]}

Never taking meals for granted was just one of the many things that I took away from my volunteering this summer.I was so excited to continue to work with this amazing organization and my experience inspired me to give more than time. I started to raise money for the food bank and found it was really easy to continue making a difference – I used the food bank’scrowdfunding pageandset up a fundraiserthat I could share with my friends and family. I shared my experiences with them throughout the summer and quickly raised more than I thought possible.My original fundraising goal was $1,000 (2,500 meals) but once I reached that goal, I extended it to a stretch goal of $2,000 (5,000 meals) and I am close to reaching that milestone now.I would like to thank CAFB, particularly Cecelia Vergaretti and Jennifer Konish and board member Linda Keene Solomon for connecting me to the CAFB.

Each bag contains snacks and food that kids can eat on their own, along with groceries that families can cook together.  Morgan Stanley’s contributions have increased access to healthy food for hundreds of low-income families and children who benefit from this program.All told, Morgan Stanley has supported the food bank, and the community it serves, with more than $300,000 in financial support since 2010!Morgan Stanley employees also give generously of their time through volunteerism. Just last month, we welcomed 20 employees to our main distribution center in Northeast DC, where they sorted 16,000 pounds of food using our conveyor belt.  The next day, much of that food was headed for the homes and plates of families throughout the region.These volunteer hours were just some of the many that Morgan Stanley groups have logged during the last 14 months, sorting thousands more pounds of food that ultimately reached men, women, and children in need.The dedication that Morgan Stanley and its employees show is a humbling reminder of the role the community and partnerships plays in making our work possible.

The packing event was the first joint service project between the three organizations, and the massive volunteer turnout came at a critical time for CAFB and its community partners.Nationwide, one in five children are hungry. In Washington D.C., the numbers increase to one in three.These sobering statistics are even more critical in the summer. “We try to feed 2,000 children a week. Families spend an extra $300 over the summer because there is no school meal plan for their children, and it is very critical to have access to nutritious meals,” said Lavette Sims, the Capital Area Food Bank’s head of development for Prince George’s County.The summer months also come with a decrease in volunteers, making it more difficult for CAFB to get food to those who need it. In just one day, the volunteers sorted and packed enough nutritious, healthy food to distribute across CAFB’s 45 sites for two months.“I think it is remarkable and amazing to see we can make an impact with hunger and youth,” said Harrison Boyd, senior associate and team leader at PwC. “The idea of children going without food is unfortunate and the fact that we can help eliminate that goes a long way.”CAFB’s collaboration with PwC and MSE emphasizes the commitment of the two company’sdouble bottom line philosophy to strive to do well as a business while also finding ways to serve a larger purpose by contributing to society and benefitting the local community.And of course, as all the organizations are proud supporters of the Capitals, Mystics, and Wizards, some of the Verizon Center’s mascots were on hand to cheer on the volunteers.The Weekend Bags program is just one of the programs the Capital Area Food Bank provides to help fill the gaps in the hunger safety net in the region.

Inspired to help Green Ridge’s residents increase their wellness, he took part in the food bank’s Health Ambassador Program, which we started to help our partners learn to cook healthy meals on a budget, connect them with resources likeRecipe CardsandProduce Guides, and share that knowledge with others.Julian started the day off by observing a breakfast cooking demo of the CAFB’sSweet Potato Hash. While preparing lunch with the group, he got hands-on experience chopping, dicing, and baking. And he finished the day by creating his own cooking demonstration plan, usinghomemade granola, yogurt, and canned pineapple. In between, he learned about the fundamentals of nutrition, and how to encourage healthier cooking and eating.“Before the program, I had zero cooking skills or knowledge,” said Julian. Now, he says, he can cook meals easily and finds the food bank’s recipe cards easy to follow.And it shows.Shortly after taking the training, Julian hosted a cooking demonstration for residents of food bank partner City of Greenbelt Apartment. Bunny, one of the participants, sampled theMexican Rice Skillet, noting that she “was impressed by the quality and flavors.” Ray, another resident, said “TheKale Saladwas a real surprise.”Pairing access to healthy food, and information about how to use it, is one of the many ways that the Capital Area Food Bank is empowering the community and building wellness among those we serve.Join the movement.\nOur free train-the-trainer educational workshops are geared to support the continued growth of our network of Food Assistance Partners.

Roman•April 21, 2016\nAt yesterday’s #Foodtank Summit, former Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman invoked a line from the 1967 movie The Graduate, in which the father-in-law of Dustin Hoffman’s character counsels in hushed tones that, in a word, “plastics” are the secret sauce of the economy’s future.  Mr. Glickman then leaned over the mic and told the foodies and influencers in the room:  “Today, food and agriculture are the secret sauce”.I have to agree.Food is one of the primary drivers of the US economy (accounting for12.6% of Americans’ household spending).Food is at the root of Americans’health.And yet.We arewastingfoodlike never before ($40 billion worth a year).And our citizens are undernourished like never before (“starved and stuffed”, as journalist Simran Sethi (@simransethi) called it).What the heck?After a day of listening to many of the country’s top influencers on topics ranging from protein in the diet to food waste to nutrition, a few of the dots began to connect:  while some of our country’s food policies once served us quite well, they don’t anymore.Many years ago, our country developed a set of policies aimed at incentivizing production.  At the time, that was a good thing.  As poor immigrants arrived, the primary outcome needed from these policies was to get enough food to those who didn’t have it.  And as agriculture developed, government wanted to aid and abet the production of calorie dense commodity crops for that same reason.  They did so, and there have been many upsides to that policy.But some of today’s problems are a clear byproduct of those production-based incentives.  Lots of food means food is cheap.  And cheap food has caused unintended consequences.\nI’m not suggesting that we work to make food more expensive.  But I am suggesting that we need to think through what we want and then work to incentivize that outcome.Currently, we are working like mad to produce plentiful cheap food, and then working like mad not to waste it.  And we are clamoring for it to be more nutritious and less processed, while failing to realize that our policies have all been constructed to produce a result that is just the opposite. We have not connected the dots. And until we do, we will grapple with the ramifications – both on the health side (“stuffed and starved”) AND on the food waste side.Simran Sethi (@simransethi) has rightly described agriculture as “a series of decisions about what to grow and not grow, and what to eat and not eat.”  At #Foodtank yesterday and today, the calls could be heard, loudly, for a recalibration of our current series of decisions to drive production not ofamplecheap food, but ofenoughnutrient dense food.At CAFB, we are among the voices calling for a change in our food system, and we’re voting with our feet and our forklifts.  With help from retailers “upstream”, and a careful eye on our inventory “downstream”, we’re building access to nutritious foods while finding ways to curb food waste.We have much farther to go, and we can’t do it alone.Join the movement.", "image_filenames": ["blo_817.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/photo-1450528039619-bdc0c2d26850.jpg"]}

Even when you control for a rising population, the number is doubling.  The trend that has walloped the United States and Europe is now moving into the developing world almost in direct proportion to the flows and consumption rates of processed foods. And it is a trend that has an outsize effect on the low income communities served by the Capital Area Food Bank: 23% of the people we are reaching have diabetes, or live with someone who does.In the face of these facts, we must ask: How long will we live with this burden of knowledge without acting?At the CAFB, our answer is: no longer.We have been working all along to improve our food supply, with bold moves to take out sheet cake and full calorie soda.  But there is more work to do, and we are doing it.

She sees particular importance for getting children access to the kinds of food that she herself did not have early in life. “If we can teach someone how to eat healthy when they’re young,” she shared, “that is important.”Along with other residents, Ms. Clark runs a food pantry at Arbor View – a food oasis within a Ward 8 food desert. The apartments are a mile away from the closest grocery store: not far for someone who has a car, but a long way for the many area residents who don’t. It is also in a neighborhood where many people live on limited incomes.The markets are, by her description, a “whole community effort.” Twice a month, Cora and resident volunteers set up farmer’s market-style food distributions, featuring fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as other foods like beans, peanut butter, and whole grain pasta. Often, a cooking demonstration is set up by a volunteer chef or resident to show how to prepare the foods available.A sign up table is also operated by community volunteers on distribution days to help people learn about other opportunities for wellness, including the CAFB’sBrown Bag and Grocery Plus programs, which provide seniors with bags of nutritious food once a month. To prevent food waste, Ms. Cora created a “share table”, where people can leave any food they won’t use for others to take.The pantry has come a long way from its humble beginnings. Ms. Clark remembers that when she first visited the Capital Area Food Bank in 2004, “the pantry used to be in one of our supply closets.” But when Arbor View went under renovation, she successfully advocated for dedicated space in the new community center. Since then, she’s built aculture of wellnessthat has inspired other CAFB food assistance partners to become hubs of nutritious food and resources in their own neighborhoods.Ms. Clark’s views on hunger are simple: “Nobody should have to suffer because of food,” she says. Thanks to her work, and the hard work of volunteers, hundreds of people in the community won’t have to.The story continues, learn about how Cora Clark helped empower a CPDC resident from another community to join the fight against hunger in partnership with the Capital Area Food Bank –Cross City Collaboration to End Hunger!", "image_filenames": ["blo_819.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cora-clark-thumbnail.jpg"]}

Pallet after pallet of water continued to be unloaded from our truck. Food bank drivers, Amtrak staff and members of the Prince George’s County Fire Department watched with a clear sense of accomplishment, knowing that the water would soon be helping the people of Flint.“Clean water, like food, is critical to health and to life itself”, said President and CEO Nancy E. Roman. “The food bank is proud to be using its truck fleet to deliver something so important”.The collection started when Elisa Miller of Prince George’s County Kentland Volunteer Fire Department encouraged students at her school to bring in water; she later expanded the collection by coordinating with four Prince George’s County Fire Departments to serve as drop off locations where members of the community could donate water.As word continued to spread, the water piled up and Elisa needed logistical assistance.  The Capital Area Food Bank’s trucks were perfect for the job. As the volunteers continued to collect water, food bank trucks made multiple visits to pick up the water from donation sites in the community. Elisa says, “[I was] happy to run into the Capital Area Food Bank. They have been a blessing in helping move this water around!”In total, the food bank picked up 20 pallets worth of water from the collection locations. That’s about 26,000 bottles of water heading to Flint. With the great work of caring members of our community and the Capital Area Food Bank essential resources will continue to be provided to those in times of need.“The region knows that we are here for them,” said Roman. “Not only to strengthen the safety net under those who struggle to afford nourishing food, but also to act as a community partner when challenges arise.”", "image_filenames": ["blo_821.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CAFB-LOAD-2.jpg"]}

For many of the households served by the Capital Area Food Bank, having access to these healthy foods are key to cooking regularly.

All of these foods fit the CAFB’s standards for wellness: they’re high in fiber, low in sugar, and low in salt.

But for the vulnerable residents of the Washington, DC region, snow days present a real and present threat. Last week’s storm Jonas couldn’t have hit at a worse time for those neighbors in the Washington metro area who struggle to access the food their family needs. Of the 540,000 neighbors served by the Capital Area Food Bank each year, 54% of those who participate in SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) report their food stamps running out before the second half of each month. The storm kept most people in their homes long after the snowfall ended, meaning that hourly workers lost wages and people were cut off from food resources at the time of the month when they need it most.Even the Capital Area Food Bank was forced to take one snow day, but by Tuesday we were back to work and ready to move food into the community where it was needed most. To address the need we first reached out to our partner network, adding food to existing orders and committing to new fresh produce drops in high need areas. Knowing many of our partners were still snowed in, we also looked to our broader network for support. We quickly found a willing and committed partner in the District Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), which has provided afterschool meals in coordination with the food bank since 2013.DPR identified eight Recreation Centersacross four high-need Wards to host an emergency food distribution the week after the storm. All centers received two types of fresh produce, ready to eat meals, packaged rice, and assorted drinks. Even with very little time for outreach, many residents participated, with close to 750 households–about 2,700 residents–receiving food. Volunteers lent their support, some even donating food on the spot. As DPR Director Keith Anderson said in theWashington Sun, “Residents having access to healthy, nutritious food is important to us and this week our expanded partnership with the Capital Area Food Bank will assist those in need.”Recreation Centers are true community hubs, and Recreation Center staff know their neighbors. This helped spur innovation during the crisis. Some centers, not getting the turnout they anticipated, kept their food distributions running until 9PM, catching parents picking up children and basketball teams after the game. Another sent teens door-to-door to drop off groceries at the homes of homebound seniors and individuals with disabilities. Each distribution was a reflection of strong community bonds and resiliency. The efforts truly epitomized our hope of creating collaborative, community responses to hunger.", "image_filenames": ["blo_823.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/EmergencyDropOff1.jpg"]}

And why is everyone else here?Could it be New Year’s resolutions? Or, as a millennial, am I just standing in line with the masses because salads “to go” are, well – cool?The reality is that I was there to grab a meal that was nutritious, and fortify my body as I started a long work week. I recognize that food is more than a meal: it’s fuel. And knowing where my fuel comes from is like a little red cherry tomato to top off my bowl.Fast forward a week to yesterday afternoon, when I found myself walking the aisles of our distribution center with the 60 members of the sweetgreen team who had come to volunteer. As we passed pallets of gigantic turnips, it struck me that the way we think about food at the Capital Area Food Bank isn’t very different from the philosophy that drives this health-forward salad company.sweetgreen is focused on providing nutritious food options, and they care a lot about where their food comes from, from the lettuce lining the bottom of a bowl to the raw beet diced into bite sized pieces balancing on top. They’re alsomaking nutrition education accessible in our communities.As an organization providing food for 12% of the local population,we’re focused on these same issues. We know we have a big role in the local food system and work hard to source food that we’re proud of and that contributes to the wellness of those we serve, whether we are loading our trucks with local apples from Toigo Farms grown by Mark Toigo, or fresh broccoli and cauliflower grown by Clayton Farms in MD.As health and wellness become increasingly important to our work, we’re grateful to have the growing partnership of organizations like sweetgreen that are focused, as we are, on nourishing children, seniors, families, and yes- millennials- that are in need of healthy food to help them grow, learn, work, and play.", "image_filenames": ["blo_824.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sgblog.jpg"]}

Roman•December 7, 2015\nSolving a problem begins with understanding it. So two years ago, the food bank set about creating a digital map to help us better understand regional hunger. Specifically, we wanted to know – to be able to see, and to show others – where the hunger safety net in the Washington metro area is functioning best, where its holes are, and, most importantly, how our work is helping to fill those holes in.To build the map, we began by looking first at the current hunger needs throughout our region, using census data about food insecurity in each census tract to create a base layer.Next, we added in data about our work, allowing us to see the nearly 45 million pounds of food we served to men, women, and children in the community via 444 community partners in the 2015 fiscal year.  We distributed those pounds on the map based on where food insecure individuals live, taking into account their access to a car or public transportation.The map’s third layer overlays the first two pieces, showing how each area’s need and the food distributed there line up.It is the map’s final layer that is setting a course for the food bank’s future work.   It highlights areas where the food that the CAFB is distributing is significantly less than the estimated amount of food needed to bridge the gap between what a family can obtain on its own and what it actually requires.These “hunger hot spots” – which show up bright red on a map consisting largely of blues and pinks – create the guideposts for a new path forward, indicating where more food or different resources are needed.In suburban Prince William County, for instance, the Hunger Heat made it clear that there is significant hunger but not enough partners to help us meet the need. As a result, the food bank has joined with Shoppers Food to turn a former school bus into a mobile feeding vehicle.  “The Bus”, as it is simply known at the food bank, travels to several sites each day throughout the summer months, providing lunch to children who may often not receive a meal at home when school is out.The map has also been an important tool in targeting resources for existing programs, such as the food bank’s school-based markets in DC’s Wards 7 and 8, a partnership with the organization Martha’s Table through which parents and children in DC’s wards 7 and 8 are able to choose food together at an in-school, market-style pantry.    The map was used to help the food bank determine which schools to roll the program out at first.Seeing the powerful ability of this map to guide our own work in such a short amount of time, the food bank quickly realized that the map could inform the work of other organizations and individuals in the broader community as well.  So just after Labor Day of this year, we released the map publicly, making this informative and visually compelling tool a free good for all to use.  In its early days of release, the map had already been viewed by tens of thousands of people. Check it out by following the link from our home page atwww.capitalareafoodbank.org.As hunger needs shift and change, the Capital Area Food Bank is committed to finding innovative, next generation ways to meet them.   Together with our community, we’re taking hunger off the map – one red spot and one neighbor – at a time.", "image_filenames": ["blo_828.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hunger-heat-map.jpg"]}

Nonetheless, I was looking forward to a new challenge.This past summer, the Shoppers Bus delivered lunches to hungry children living in Prince William County and made four daily stops.  On my first day, I made it through the first two stops feeling pretty confident about my bus driving capabilities.  At each of the two stops, the kids were waiting for the bus when I arrived and I served them lunch, talked with them for a bit and proceeded to the next stop.  But when I got to the third stop, a trailer park, I lingered.  There was a make-shift playground with kids playing barefoot because they didn’t have shoes.  The trailers were very small and old. This was my first experience seeing real poverty.When I pulled up, the children swarmed the bus like birds and wanted to know my name. Was I “the new bus driver” and “did I have candy?” One boy, who everyone called Buddy, took a particular interest in the bus and wanted me to show him how all the buttons worked and where the lunches were stored.  I let Buddy push the buttons on the bus and showed him the refrigeration.  Over the course of the week, Buddy greeted me every day and he got me out of my shell.  Instead of just delivering the lunches, I played some soccer and football with the kids, talked with a few of them, and even participated in a water balloon fight.  I met Buddy’s mom and some of the other families as well.The Shoppers Bus is a great idea and helped get lunch to children and families who clearly lacked resources.  I enjoyed my time driving the bus and met some great people, especially “Buddy.”  I would love to drive the bus again if I’m needed.  But I probably wouldn’t participate in any water balloon fights.", "image_filenames": ["blo_829.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Truck.jpg"]}

He has since been instrumental in encouraging City Council members, School Board office staff, and the Community Center to be part of the monthly Market.  Volunteering together, these supporters receive the food from the CAFB’s truck, and get the Family Market set up and ready to go.Manassas Park is a small school district, but they have strong community ties and the support for the CAFB’s Family Market goes beyond the school administration. At the market I attended, the police and fire department were there to do some heavy lifting, and one of the firemen even repaired our smoothie bike so students could keep pedaling their way to a healthy snack!Two of the CAFB’s food assistance partners in Manassas–House of Mercy and SERVE–are also involved in the Market.  House of Mercy donates books from their thrift store so that the children who attend the market can choose a book to take home while the family shops.  SERVE, another partner, coordinates a taste testing ofa CAFB recipeand gives the recipe to families to take home and try in their own kitchen.  SERVE also talks to the more than 250 families in line at the distribution each month to offer SNAP application assistance, and to let them know about the other social services they offer.Finally, thanks to a generous grant from the J.O.Y. Fund at The Community Foundation for Northern Virginia, this market is fully funded for the year. This financial support, when coupled with the on-the-ground work of volunteers, rounds out the community response.  This Family Market has been extraordinarily successful, and the driving force has been the collaborative partnerships and individuals in the community who are working to solve hunger and its companion problems: chronic undernutrition, heart disease, and obesity.\n", "image_filenames": ["blo_834.png"], "image_links": ["https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/homepage1.jpg"]}

Well, Iwasskeptical up until recently.While any kind of canned protein is a wellness boon for the kitchen cupboard, my mind couldn’t move beyond the canned part of canned chicken. Even as a lifelong canned tuna and salmon eater, in my mind chicken was set apart from its canned protein cousins. So I decided to challenge this culinary mental block and added a few cans to my grocery cart.Armed with the Capital Area Food Bank’s ownrecipe for Curried Chicken Salad, I stood over the kitchen counter and forked the contents out into a bowl. Then I mixed the chicken with chopped onion, curry powder, chopped apple and mayo.The verdict: delightful. The sweet notes of the apple, curry and mayo fit perfectly with the meaty chicken flavor.  And the creamy texture combined with crunchy apple kept the mouth entertained; grapes are an alternate fruit option that would work just as well. The fruit and onion add-ins stretched the chicken and made the recipe go farther, upping the recipe’s affordability. I spread some on a piece of bread, topped the open faced sandwich with cheese, and we all melted. In a bowl, on a cracker or in a wrap, this recipe would taste good in any form.This kitchen adventure has really paid off, as I now have a new high-protein meal that I can whip out quickly, as long as I have a can of chicken in the cabinet. The curried chicken salad has made multiple appearances on my table through the month, and canned chicken (Costco brand is really tasty) is now a pantry staple.The CAFB is gearing up to release a cookbook next summer that will show how the food we distribute can easily become healthy, affordable meals.

So kids eating a bag of chips are getting lots of energy (which gets stored as fat when it isn’t used), but they might finish the bag still hungry.\nWhich gets me back to my refrain:  At CAFB, we are working to make sure those kids have access to vegetables and protein.  And we’ve got to keep at the task of presenting fun, inexpensive ways to prepare that food, making the healthy choice the easy choice. It’s all part of the broader movement to end hunger that we are working, each day, to create.\n", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Early childhood malnutrition also is tied to conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life.\n• Lack of adequate healthy food can impair a child’s ability to concentrate and perform well in school and is linked to higher levels of behavioral and emotional problems from preschool through adolescence.\nIf that doesn’t underscore the critical nature of getting good food to folks early, I don’t know what does.\nThe Capital Area Food Bank is on the front lines, working to support the health of children and their families in every community by providing access to good, healthy food.Join the movementandspread the word.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Roman•October 16, 2015\nIt’s World Food Day, and congratulations are in order for the global community working on hunger for the progress that has been made.  According toa study released this week and covered in today’s Washington Post, overall hunger in developing countries has fallen 27 percent in the last 15 years.  It has been halved in 17 countries.  That is indisputably good news.   The article rightly focuses on the 44 countries who still have too many malnourished citizens.\nBut there is one thing it doesn’t mention that we cannot lose sight of.  While the calorie deficit has been almost fully addressed in the developed world, far too many low income people here and across the country aren’t able to access the right kind of food. They must often rely on fast, cheap calories that stave off a growling stomach but deliver very few nutrients.\nThe result is an insidious, often invisible kind of hunger, defined by chronic undernourishment, obesity, and diet-related illnesses like diabetes and heart disease.\nA teen who eats a honey bun for breakfast, fast food for lunch, and a bag of chips for dinner, for example, will spend about $7 for food.  Along with very high amounts of salt and sugar, she will consume more than the kilocalories necessary to produce energy for a day, some of which will likely be stored as fat.  But her cells are not being infused with the vitamin A, B, C, E, and riboflavin she needs. She lacks the protein required to keep muscle tissue strong and to fight infection (which can mean the difference between attending school or not).  She may well be overweight or obese – preciselybecauseshe is hungry.\nRight here in Washington DC, about 700,000 people struggle to put food on the table.  The challenge for them is to not only secure food, but ultimately to secure the resources that enable them to provide healthy food to their families – and in the interim to get access to food that will help them thrive and be well, rather than contribute to disease and poor nourishment.\nOn this World Food Day, we need to keep acknowledging the very real progress that so many have contributed to, while we keep our eye sharply on the remaining challenge.\n\n", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

The eggplant in the Agency Mart today was the reward reaped from the strong ties he forms with local farmers. Lucky for us, now this eggplant will go to neighbors in need.\nBut these “purple eggs” come with questions. A common one:what can I make with eggplant? Eggplant is a virtuous vegetable and here’s why we love it: it is easy to cut, does not require peeling or seed scraping, and offers a meaty texture to sauces and stir fries.\nHere is aSpicy EggplantRecipe from theCAFB Kitchenthat I prepared at home last night (my garden has a similar end of season prolific eggplant situation going on).\nFor a firm texture, it is advised to salt the eggplant to draw out water.

When I was a little boy, my parents would drive through our nation’s capital and I often wondered why some people were less fortunate, and whether they had enough to eat. The thought would break my heart, but I knew that one day I would be in a position to help.\nI am a firm believer that action is a cause set in motion, and that cause produces an effect. So about 8 years ago, my wife and I decided to put together an event for patients in our medical office that would help collect food donations for the Capital Area Food Bank. In just two years, the event outgrew our office space. We later moved to nearby restaurants in an effort to include more of the community and the event has since taken off. With the help of patients, local athletes, news media, local schools, chambers of commerce, family and friends, this event continues to grow. To date we have raised over $10,000 for the Capital Area Food Bank and collected approximately 10,000 pounds of food.\nToday kicks off my 8th Annual Food Drive Event for Capital Area Food Bank. It’s an event close to my heart for many reasons, but primarily because it takes care of those less fortunate right here in our own backyards. For the past 8 years, the goal of the event has been to raise hunger awareness, food, and funds.. My personal mission has been to remind others of the responsibility we have as a community to make sure everyone has enoughhealthy food. I think that’s just a basic right people should have.\nSolving hunger lays the foundation for progress in many areas of development, including health, wellness, and education. Well-nourished women have healthier babies whose immune systems are stronger for life. A healthy, well-fed child is also more likely to attend and flourish in school.\nAs a leader in the medical field, I have witnessed how important having access to healthy food is for preventing diseases like diabetes and heart disease. From the bottom of my heart, I invite you to join us this year in raising food and funds to continue to solve the issue of hunger that is right here in our own backyards.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Even though the Capital Area Food Bank’s D.C. headquarters is located just blocks away from where Pope Francis will be celebrating Mass, the so-called “Francis effect” has taken hold: the largest hunger non-profit in the area has found a way to keep food flow uninterrupted during the events at Catholic University.\nWith much of the city being subjected to strict road closures effecting many parts of the District, including the CAFB’s immediate neighborhood, CAFB CEO Nancy Roman and Senior Operations Director Mark Jaquez have had to think outside the box. Food delivery trucks will be staged Wednesday at one of the food bank’s 444 community food assistance partners, Shabach! Resource and Empowerment Center in Brightseat, MD. From there, food will be able to reach the people who need it. This diverting of vehicles away from Brookland will prevent any unnecessary bottlenecking around the food bank.\nThis pontiff’s unwavering message of compassion has inspired many who work in the hunger-relief movement, so temporarily suspending operations was not an option for CAFB President and CEO Nancy Roman. “How can we keep our hunger safety net strong in spite of road closures associated with the papal visit?” asked Roman. “Pope Francis wouldn’t want us to close down because of his visit, and we aren’t” she said, adding that “with nearly 700,000 people in our region struggling to get enough food to eat, we must remain open.”\nThis week’s visit to the United States by Pope Francis will include an address to a joint session of Congress, which many speculate will have a strong social justice theme. The 78-year-old leader of the Roman Catholic Church has spoken openly and frankly about caring for those in need. For the food bank, this means taking a few extra steps to ensure that operations do not cease during his visit – something that the pope himself would certainly applaud.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

The food sitting high in the racks quietly waits to be moved from the shelves and transported into the community, while pallet jacks and forklifts buzz and beep below.\nOver the years, I have come to think of these food racks as a giant oversized medicine cabinet. A medicine cabinet that helps build a foundation for wellness, both individually and collectively. Food with the potential to help those struggling with diet related illness, to gain control over their own wellness (in my short stint as a diabetes counselor, I was always amazed when clients’ blood sugars normalized after making small food and lifestyle changes).\nSo when the food bank amped up efforts to focus on wellness three years ago, it was decided we would take a long hard look at our food through the lens of salt, sugar and fiber, to see how well the food stacked in the distribution center stacked up to wellness.\nFast forward to the present and, with the help of technology, teamwork and time, we now have the ability to take a wide look at our food through a wellness angle, set aspirational inventory goals and strategically source food accordingly.\nUnderstanding our food landscape has also set the foundation forPartners for Wellness, a community based wellness program that provides food assistance partners with resources to provide good food to the community as well as promotional resources like recipe cards.\nWellness at the Capital Area Food Bank will always be central to our work and we now have data and systems to know where we need to go when it comes to our food.

At some medical schools, such as Tulane University, these courses have become mandatory.As I swerved around a particularly deep pot hole that I’d fallen into the night before, I heard cardiologist Stephen Devries note that during his intensive four-year cardiology program, he didn’t receive a single minute of training on nutrition. Convinced that the medical community needs to start connecting nutrition with medical care, Devries is working with fellow nutrition advocates to change accreditation standards, incorporate nutrition questions into medical board exams and tie medical training grants to nutrition education.Though in one way it sounds like common sense, it still borders on revolutionary to think of nutrition as directly linked to heart health.And the failure to connect the two has produced health outcomes that are downright scary. Case in point:Fully one half of the 540,000 people served by the Capital Area Food Bank have high blood pressure or heart disease or are living with someone who does.Half!Staggering.Those of us working on hunger in this country, where the issue so often manifests as chronically poor nutrition rather than a shortage of calories, understand well that hunger undermines health. We know it destroys immune systems. We know that it makes it harder for seniors to absorb their medications. And we certainly understand the link between sodium-laden fast food and high blood pressure.The medical community is waking up to this powerful reality, and the equally powerful economic truth that diet-related prevention is a heck of a lot cheaper than end-of-life sick care.That’s why we’re channeling so much fresh produce into the community.  That’s why we’re monitoring and evaluating the salt, sugar, and fiber in our inventory through a nutrition tracker, and assiduously working to improve its health.And that’s why we’re providing tools, incentives, and recognition to help our 469 food assistance partners join in the wellness effort.Together, we can contribute to the health of our community.Join the movement!", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Yes, but there’s even more to come! In D.C., the conditions for growing lettuces and radishes are favorable at the beginning and end of the growing season but are too hot and harsh at the height of summer (think back to the blooming, bolted lettuce). In order to grow as much lettuce as possible, the team is planting more lettuce that will thrive in the cooler months after the summer heat begins to wane.And didn’t we just plant peas last week? Of course, but there’s no such thing as too much peas! This is an example of succession planting – another gardening technique that makes use of a plant’s entire window of growing opportunity. By planting a few more peas every week for the next few weeks, the garden will have a longer period of harvest resulting in more fresh peas to donate to partners.Come VolunteerIf you are interested in joining the garden team, learning more about plants, dirt, bees, or growing food, or want to experience the garden for yourself, there are many ways you can get involved.

And 49% have high blood pressure, also caused by factors like being overweight and consuming excessive salt. We’ve all seen kids on the metro eating chips on their way to school; that’s because 70% of those we serve report purchasing “inexpensive, unhealthy” food as the primary way they cope with not have consistent access to nutritious food. Not only are our clients dealing with diet related illnesses and making ends meet with unhealthy food, but they are relying on food pantries more often to make ends meet.So we decided to do something about it: Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) has an initiative called Partners for Wellness. By recognizing our food assistance partners—the non-profits who receive food from the CAFB and distribute it in neighborhoods across DC, Maryland and Virginia—who are committed to distributing healthy food and pairing it with nutrition resources for their clients, we will see a positive impact in the community.The initiative builds on the work of our Food Resources team, who source all of the CAFB’s food from farmers, retailers, manufacturers, and other donors. They developed a system to track the nutritional value of our food by looking at how much salt, sugar, and fiber is in the fruits, vegetables, and groceries we distribute. This effort, led by our staff dietitian, Renee Kee, and managed by our Nutrition Education Coordinator, Katherine Donnelly, in collaboration with our food assistance partners, doctors, and public health experts, allows us to track the percentage of nutrient rich foods that we offer our partners. Through the Partners for Wellness program, our partners are able to see the nutritional value of the food they access through us via nutrition reports and on our online menu. Recipe cards and produces guides are also available to our partners.Those that are interested in participating in Partners for Wellness can find aninformation packet and application here.

Okra, tomatoes and beans are new on the menu.Peak WeekWhile some plants are just getting started in the garden, some are growing wild! Thecucumber trelliseshave put the garden team in a pickle because they have produced so many branches that they simply don’t fit in their bed. This is really a great problem to have because the harvest is bountiful, so the output is worth the mess. The Little Leaf variety of pickling cucumbers was bred for its high yield. Can you believe this entire bed started withonly 6 seeds?\nThe garden’syardlong beansare also nearing their peak in production. These “bean snakes” are prepared exactly like a dry bean (kidney or black beans). They may look exotic and wild, but they’ll taste just like the beans sold in the grocery store. The garden team chose to grow theseRed Noodle beansin an effort to grow as many beans that can be grown per planting space. It’s a simple equation: if one seed produces one plant and Plant A produces 3 times as much food as Plant B, a grower with enough space for only one seed should plant the seed from Plant A.The transition from summer-harvest to fall is continuing this week with the addition of thespaghetti squash. This delicious member of the gourd family is replacing the lettuce that bolted a few weeks ago. Its presence will diversify the soil, replenishing it with nutrients the lettuce didn’t have and taking away nutrients the lettuce didn’t need.Tomato Harvest PartyThis week the garden team is hosting aTomato Harvest Party, along with a group from GE Capital for a mass harvest of all the tomato and pepper plants.

Fortunately, it also has seniors ready to fight to make sure everyone has food as well as a caring community that feeds souls and bodies. The Capital Area Food Bank’s slogan “Senior Strong” comes to life through its community partner We Are Family and its senior leaders like those at Kelsey Apartments in the Columbia Heights neighborhood.As a young man, Herb Price came to D.C. to find work not long before the 1968 riots after Dr. Martin Luther King was shot. “D.C. has changed a lot since my early days in the area, but one thing has not: my sense that–as MLK believed–we are on this earth to be of service to others,” Mr. Price recalls.  When Mr. Price moved into Kelsey Apartments in Columbia Heights in 2006, he encountered We Are Family, then coordinated onsite by senior leader Thelma Warfield.The Capital Area Food Bank provides nutritious food to We Are Family through its “Grocery Plus” program, which volunteers assemble into bags. We Are Family not only provides this food for seniors when they are about to run out at the end of the month, but it provides transportation for shopping, voting and attending city council hearings, among many other services.“I was so moved by the work We Are Family did with the folks in my building that I wanted to join in with the monthly grocery delivery,” Mr. Price says. When Ms. Warfield passed away in 2009, Mr. Price stepped up to fill her role as the coordinator for the delivery to more than 100 low-income Kelsey residents.Through his service, Mr. Price has befriended many of his neighbors. “I am now someone that many of them turn to when they need help  — and this is what We Are Family is all about–looking after one another.I could see the pride that folks feel, to be pitching in and helping out, and I feel it myself. For We Are Family, seniors still have so much to give, despite our challenges. Sometimes being able to give is even more important than receiving … It makes you feel alive!”Through folks like Mr. Price and his coworkers Fredrick McComb, Elizabeth Stockton, Johnny Williams, Ron Grey, Ben Parren, Sheila McIntire and George Golphin, the idea of “senior strong” comes alive.“This isn’t rocket science,”Mr. Price says — with a mischievous smile flitting across his face. “It is just how people should live, taking care of one another, being our brother’s keeper. I’m not that special. Anyone can do it! So why don’t we?”(Written by Mark Andersen, Co-Director of We Are Family.

Strawberries fruit early (in May) and spend the hottest part of the summer preparing for next year’s fruit. They grow extra stems, calledrunnersthat grow roots and become fruit-bearing crowns by next year.Container GardenThe container garden has also experienced a transition. The larger containers now house the taller variety of blueberries, demonstrating how little dirt is needed to grow delicious blueberries. Also growing in containers are tomatoes, beets, kale, marigolds and asparagus. While it isn’t the most traditional way to grow food, containers offer many benefits to growers.Containers:\nContainers are planted just like the traditional beds. Just pick a container, pour in some good dirt, and plant your favorite flower or veggie. It’s an easy and productive way to grow plants that the garden uses it as one of the gardening method demonstrations.This week, the garden team is continuing to harvest, weed, and plant as well as train all the climbing vegetables togrow upward. The bean, tomato, and cucumber beds are all getting revamped this week with stakes, ties, trellises, and other contraptions to encourage the plants to climb vertically instead of splaying out in the dirt. Vertical growing is just another way that the garden works to grow more food in a smaller space.Come VolunteerStop by our garden sometime to see the different methods we demonstrate of gardening.

The CAFB will purchase nearly 400,000 pounds of fresh produce, prioritizing greens over starch-heavy, higher-calorie vegetables like potatoes and corn.The Fund, made possible through the generous support of the Marriot Foundation, operates during the growing season. Five farms in the Washington metro area grow a set quantity of nine different produce varieties for the CAFB at a pre-determined price point.  The CAFB picks each harvest up at the farm and then distributes to 16 of its nearly 500 food assistance partners located in Suburban Maryland, Northern Virginia and the District to feed people in need.  The CAFB partners, including churches, food pantries, and community centers, also receive educational materials such as CAFB recipes to help clients transform ingredients into healthy meals.The CAFB’s greens are being delivered this summer directly from Bartenfelder Farms in Preston, Maryland and will continue to arrive through December.  This partnership provides local farmers like Joe Bartenfelder, who owns the farm and currently serves as Maryland Secretary of Agriculture, a guaranteed revenue source. It also allows the CAFB to forecast exactly what produce varieties will be available for its partners on which dates, so its nutrition education staff can plan educational resources around the seasonal fruits and vegetables.The Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Fund serves as just one example of the food bank’s commitment to boosting the health and wellness of the 540,000 residents it feeds in the Washington metro area who lack access to healthy food.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

It was her call to action and in this way, she succeeded as a champion for those with the greatest of need. While children ate a meal, they received tutoring. When she gave food to young, single mothers, she dispensed advice. When she fed the many homeless men that gathered near the center, she provided a listening ear for their troubles. When she came to the food bank, she provided encouragement for the staff here. She would tell us, “Keep doing what you are doing, it is helping out there.” Believe me when she said that to you, you stood a little taller and if you were having a bad day, it got better. Ms. Hawkins had that ability to bring the best out in both the people she served and who she worked with. Hannah Hawkins had her own children, but no matter who you were, you knew you were a “child of hers.”\nWhen you visit the Children of Mine center, you will not see a great cathedral, you will see a building that has seen better days. If you had the privilege of meeting Ms. Hawkins you would not believe that she, so small in stature, used that building to feed, clothe and encourage thousands of children, families and seniors in her community. She was a tireless champion of all her arms could enfold.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

She embraced her parents’ values and work ethic and worked her way through college, graduating from NYU with a B.A. in Social Work.  She and her husband first made their home in Alexandria, VA while he was stationed at Ft. Belvoir and she worked at the Barney Neighborhood House.  After getting her children off to a good start, Judy got her M.S.W. in Clinical Social Work from Catholic University.For twenty years, Mrs. Shaffert worked at the Jewish Council for the Aging, founding and directing many initiative to improve the lives of seniors.  During that time, Judy’s inventiveness and determination strengthened programs to improve housing, employment, counseling, nutrition, and social, intellectual and recreational opportunities that nourish the spirit.  She retired as Assistant Executive Director in 1993.With this legacy gift through her daughter and son-in-law, Judy again touches the lives of seniors, about whom she cared so much in life, with nourishing food that brightens the day for older men and women in the greater Washington area.This gift is unusual in size, but not in heart.  The Capital Area Food Bank is very fortunate in the number of gifts and donations from many Washingtonians who feel as we do; that concern and care for our entire community is the only way to live our days as a neighbors.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Roman•June 8, 2015\nThis is part two of a four-part tribute to Hannah Hawkins. Read thefirst,thirdandfourthparts.I loved that when I visited Hannah atChildren of Mine, which I did a couple of times, she would passionately address whatever we were talking about (types of food, children’s needs) but always break away from our conversation to engage a child – sometimes firmly if he was acting up or sometimes lovingly when a need was expressed, but she always had a large part of her heart and mind on the children.I loved it that during board meetings, when we would burrow down into technical issues regarding the budget or metrics, she would break into a soulful account that the bottom line was all about hungry people – hungry children, hungry men and hungry women. She would remind us that the lines were long at Children of Mine, that the need was deep and great, that hunger was real … and suddenly, budget details seemed less important.I loved it that she always stopped each and every time I saw her on the shopping floor, or in the Partner Agency lounge, to let me know what was on her mind and something important wasalwayson her mind.I loved it that she gave shout outs to the staff often – and most often to Steve Schulman, our Agency Mart Manager. But also to Jody Tick, Senior Director of Food Resources and Programs, and all those who worked with her on the garden for Children of Mine.I loved it even when she called me while I was driving in the car one night late to talk about food selection and quality at the food bank. Why did I love it that she was calling way past business hours?  Because she cared.  She was passionate, and although I didn’t always agree with her viewpoint, I deeply admired her passion and how that passion translated into warm food and warm arms wrapped around her children in endless support for those she served.I did not love it that the last three or four times that I saw Hannah, slimmer and slighter each time, and could feel the energy ebbing from her. It was clear she was not well.

So when her granddaughter called and informed me that her “Mom had passed” – there was only silence.The silence was not just mine but belonged to the hundreds of children she fed and mentored daily at the Children of Mine Center she founded over 30 years ago; hundreds of homeless men she clothed, offered haircuts and compassion; families that leaned on her for support; and the voiceless for whom she fought for and gave a voice.Ms. Hawkins worked tirelessly to address the issue of hunger in Ward 8 and helped launch the CAFB’sFrom the Ground Up in the Communityat Children of Mine Center in 2009, a joint initiative that educated low-income youth in the Anacostia community about nutrition, as well as the social and environmental benefits of growing fresh produce.From the Ground Up in the Communitywas a hands-on urban gardening experience that provided children access and exposure to fresh produce; fostered basic gardening skills; engaged youth in the basics of cooking with fresh produce; and ensured a safe garden space that instilled a sense of pride while creating a place of beauty in the community.Director of the CAFB’s Partner and Programs, Susan Topping, who worked with Ms. Hawkins on the FGU initiative, remembered, “working in the garden with the kids – Monday was Nutrition Day, Tuesday was Gardening and Thursday was Cooking.  Everyone came for cooking! And part of the reason was that so many of the children wanted to show Ms. Hawkins what they made.  They were so proud of what they had learned and a little praise from Ms. Hawkins went a long way for everyone she touched.”Ms. Hawkins helped to improve the lives of countless people and her passion has left an indelible mark on the food bank and the region.“I can’t imagine the loss for the kids who depended on her,” Topping reflected. “Children who came to her center from the age of four when they had absolutely no one else to watch over them. Things were often in disrepair but she was a constant in so many lives that were in flux and chaos – she will be remembered and honored by many, and certainly by me.”Even in silence, Ms. Hawkins’ vigor lives on through the spark she ignited in others.  The Children of Mine Center will continue to serve as a beacon of hope for the community with the help of dedicated volunteers, including a former student in her after-school program.Clickhereto learn how you can help carry on the legacy of the late, great Hannah Hawkins.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

The farm is one of two Community Supported Agriculture farms that the CAFB partners with forFresh Produce Grant– the other farm isWaterpenny Farmin Sperryville, Virginia.While at the farm, staff divided into three groups – one group transferred red pepper seedlings into the ground while riding an old-fashioned tractor; another group weeded the radish beds; and the final group transferred four variations of lettuces into a bed near the radishes. After lunch at the picnic benches under the shade and a puppy-petting session with two of the farm’s dogs, the group got back to work adding a semi-permeable cover over one of the previously planted beds. To finish up the day at Clagett, staff completed the intricate process of transferring ground cherries into rows near the house.The CAFB began the Fresh Produce Grant program nearly a decade ago. Eight partners are selected by the food bank to receive the grant each year and are connected with Clagett Farm to pick up produce every two weeks on a rotating schedule (four partners each week).  An additional partner is selected to pick up produce from Waterpenny Farm. The fresh produce they receive averages 400 pounds per pickup. Part of the grant requires the food assistance partners to attend at least one educational workshop at the food bank and host a workshop for their clients.Clagett Farm sells roughly half of its produce to customers in the D.C. area and donates the other portion to the CAFB.

{"title": "Seniors and Grocery Plus: An International Affair", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2015/05/28/seniors-and-grocery-plus-an-international-affair/", "date": "May 28, 2015", "content": "ByGus May•May 28, 2015\nNFESH’s annualState of Senior Hunger in Americareport recently ranked the District of Columbia as one of the top five worst “states” for senior hunger nationally, which should leave any resident of our nation’s capital wondering not only what went wrong, but what can be done.The Capital Area Food Bank, the largest hunger organization serving Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia, is campaigning throughout the month of May (did you know it’s Older American’s Month?) to ensure all seniors in need have access to nourishing meals so they can staySenior Strong. So what does senior hunger look like across the DC area?Washington, DC is broadly acknowledged as an international, multicultural city. Yet while the city may be known as a hub for international visitors, like diplomats and tourists, it is also home to specific ethnic groups that immigrated to the area seeking opportunity. These individuals infuse and enrich the culture of Washington as well as the experience of the Capital Area Food Bank’s supplemental food program for DC Seniors,Grocery Plus.  Of the 5,300 active participants in Grocery Plus, about 700 (13%) are immigrants from other parts of the world, mostly Latin America and Asia. As seniors, they face similar financial challenges to our other program participants, but they also create connections through culture and tradition which builds strength and resiliency.The Grocery Plus program has maintained longtime partnerships with rich cultural hubs throughout DC where seniors gather to socialize, exercise, share meals, and generally enjoy each other’s company. Often times, these hubs are places where cultural traditions are preserved and cherished, such as the Asian and Pacific Islander Senior Center, nestled underneath a historic church in Chinatown. On a recent visit there, I was struck by the array of activities the attendees, who were predominately Chinese, participated in. In one room, a group of men and women sang traditional Chinese songs while one played along with a classical two-string Chinese guitar. Down the corridor, a group of seniors made handcrafted trinkets to send to family members back in China, right around the corner from a lively, synchronized aerobics class. Despite the creaky floors, low basement ceilings and lack of furnishings, there was a wonderful richness in the warmth and positive energy spread by the hundreds of seniors at this center who shared both the physical space and a cultural connection.A few  neighborhoods over from Chinatown is Adams Morgan, which is home to a large number of El Salvadorans, many of whom flocked to the Washington area during the Salvadoran Civil War of the 1980s and early 90s. In this neighborhood, Grocery Plus has partnered with the VIDA Senior Center, a staple in the community for over 25 years, which serves over 150 Grocery Plus participants each month, in addition to providing a host of other health, nutrition, and wellness services for mostly Latino seniors. They even provide opportunities for seniors of Central American descent to spice up their monthly food deliveries by adding ingredients from their homelands to Grocery Plus food staples, such as grits. Add a little avocado, a hint of flavored cheese, and marinated cabbage and traditionally southern grits become a Salvadorian specialty.With food at the heart of community, we can ensure the continued presence of multiculturalism and tradition within Washington, DC for its seniors and the many generations to follow.Consider a contributionto the Capital Area Food Bank today to give older adults the boost they need to stay well and remainSenior Strong.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Shallal also revealed plans for the Busboys and Poets project that will serve the Anacostia neighborhood, providing job training and employment opportunities to an area the Capital Area Food Bank and our partners serve regularly due to a lack of grocery stores and other options for healthy food there.\nTheFood Bank Networkwas launched at the Summit, which allows anyone to find service providers online—including food, job training, or health care–simply by entering their zip code. Erine Gray, who founded the software he callsAunt Bertha, discussed why he created this social search engine to “design dignity in every step.” We hope this allows people to better search for the services they need and helps our partners and other service providers connect with one another.\nLast but not least, the CAFB awarded a very small group of its most committed partners with recognition for the part they’ve played in ending hunger in the Washington metro area.

People are forever playing catch up with him at Samuel Kelsey Apartments in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington, D.C., where he is a volunteer site leader for the Capital Area Food Bank’s Grocery Plus program. As a site leader, James tirelessly connects over 150 of his peers—seniors over the age of 60 —to food assistance.The Grocery Plus program depends on site leaders like James. The role of the leader is to help neighbors register for the program, communicate with the CAFB, hand out food and generally provide a helping hand to their community in need. They are instrumental in helping solve senior hunger.However, James is not “just” a site leader. He is a pillar of the community. Grocery Plus is merely a small portion of his volunteerism.Impressively, James finds time to help his fellow seniors with many tasks and activities they are no longer able to perform. He shops for groceries for his homebound neighbors, he moves and packs for his physically handicapped friends, and he is on-call whenever anyone in the building needs a hand with cleaning, paying bills or a number of the other tasks that become more challenging as his neighbors age. He earnestly believes that life isn’t about yesterday, or about how hard today is, but what you can do in a day for those you care about.Though James is also a Grocery Plus participant, he exemplifies the strength and power of a well-nourished senior and is living proof that people in need aren’t helpless, but often helpful and resourceful.He knows how much the Grocery Plus food benefits his fellow residents at Samuel Kelsey. He relishes opportunities to help his fellow seniors and loves sharing ideas for home-cooked recipes using Grocery Plus ingredients.  And when the Grocery Plus deliveries arrive, Mr. Leak is sure to remind his fellow seniors to keep it moving!Throughout the month of May, the CAFB is campaigning to ensure all seniors in need have access to nourishing meals.Consider a contributiontoday to give older adults the boost they need to stay well and remainSenior Strong.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

However, the Capital Area Food Bank’s 12th Annual Blue Jeans Ball might have stolen the spotlight Sunday night.Sure, President Obama had some great jabs and help from aringside anger translator. But, the Blue Jeans Ball pulled no punches and dealt a decisive blow to hunger in the Washington metro area.The knockout punch came late Sunday evening when Bill Conway, Co-Founder, Co-CEO and Managing Director of The Carlyle Group, announced a $1 million donation to the Capital Area Food Bank.“This will allow us to reach more people with fresher food,” said CAFB President Nancy Roman. “It will push produce even deeper into the reaches of our distribution area, as far out as Manassas and southern Prince Georges County.”The announcement, made to a crowd of 900 guests, put a defining exclamation mark on a night that had already raised over $441,000 for the CAFB.The donation will be provided by the Bedford Falls Foundation, a private charitable trust established by Bill and Joanne Conway in 1997.  The foundation made the CAFB’s 2013 move into its new facility possible.The night ended as strong as it began. As soon as the doors opened, supporters, decked out in their fashionable denim, came in droves to partake in the silent auction and sample food from 40 of thearea’s top restaurants.Despite an amazing array of good food, libations and tunes thanks to John Jaeger’s The Elastic Waist Band, many still speculated participants wouldn’t last the distance given it was a Sunday night… and there’s work the next day… or kids and their school… orGame of Thrones… or whatever. However, all those concerns were demonstrably set aside as cheers rang out all the way to last call.It’s now time to turn that merriment into nourishment. Recognizing that 22 percent of households it serves have a family member with diabetes, and 48 percent have a family member with high blood pressure, the CAFB is committed to increasing access to healthful food.Nearly, 33 percent of total pounds that exit the food bank are fresh produce (see carrot). And thanks to all the generous Blue Jeans Ball supporters, the Capital Area Food Bank is already eyeballing ways to inject more fruits and vegetables into communities where it is most needed.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Through a partnership with the Capital Area Food Bank, WAMU not only campaigned in support of public radio, but it also helped raise hunger awareness and give donors an opportunity to feed people in need.The CAFB, its partners and all those affected by hunger are greatly appreciative of all the air time WAMU provided.In between segments of Morning Edition, The Diane Rehm Show and other programs, WAMU hosts reported on the work of the Capital Area Food Bank and shared stories fromCAFB partners.Clearly, this appealed to the WAMU community at large. Of those who opted for a thank you gift, 85% chose to give meals. Said one WAMU member:\nThis ultimately was ahuge win for both organizations. Thanks to the outpouring of support, WAMU exceeded its fundraising goals and will provide the CAFB with 120,000 meals.Thanks WAMU 88.5 for a tremendous partnership opportunity!

Last year’s campaign raised a record $130,000 for the CAFB.This year’s campaign is set to be the biggest yet. “There are more lawyers per capita in D.C. than any other city in the U.S., so the legal community has an opportunity to have a significant impact on hunger in our region,” said Carl Vacketta, retired partner at DLA Piper, CAFB Board Secretary and honorary chairman of the 2015 campaign. “This year we’re hoping to reach an unprecedented scale by raising $200,000 for the campaign.”The campaign is already well on its way to meeting this ambitious goal – almost two months before the kickoff, 30 firms have already pledged a total of $131,000.This year, firms have more tools to help their team to be successful. Teams can fundraise through the food bank’s new in-house crowdfunding platform. Three volunteer opportunities throughout the month allow lawyers to take their engagement with the campaign one step further by donating time distributing food at client-direct programs and packing and sorting food at the CAFB’s Northeast distribution center. The National Law Journal, Legal Times and Washington Business Journal provided support by running ads to encourage firms to register for the campaign.Funds from the campaign come at an opportune time in June to raise awareness about childhood hunger. Each year, the food bank sees an increased need during the summer months when students are out of school and do not have access to school meals.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Even though we receive positive feedback from community groups, we often wonder if we are getting it right.This past December, we invited community members who’ve experienced hunger firsthand, as well as some of our food assistance partners, to the Four Corners Campus of Silver Spring United Methodist Church. None of the individuals had ever participated in Face Hunger, so we wanted to know if we were telling the right stories.We started the morning by running through the simulation and discussion as usual. Then everyone sat down to share their reaction. All the participants responded that the “simulation was right on point.”The conversation evolved into a rich discussion about the very real challenges in the simulation from getting healthy food on the table, to the difficulties of applying for assistance programs and only having access to a convenience store to buy groceries. The group agreed that you can’t look at a person and know their situation; and that compassion and understanding without judgment are critical to supporting struggling families.\nWith an issue as big as hunger, affecting 1 in every 6 Americans, there’s no way to tell the whole story in an hour. Face Hunger, however, is a great way to get a taste of the daily challenges faced by those struggling to feed their families and think about ways we can all help. For more information about the program, look at our Face Hunger page or contact Amanda Melara atamelara@capitalareafoodbank.org.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

A partnership between the Capital Area Food Bank andMartha’s Table, Joyful Food Markets are monthly, pop-up grocery stores in schools which provide families with 23 pounds of free, non-perishable groceries and fresh produce per enrolled child. Markets are joyful, community events where parents and children watch cooking demonstrations and take part in food preparation tutorials while sampling healthy, simple recipes they can recreate at home. At the Moten Joyful Food Market, Chef Spike got hands on with Market ingredients, preparing a glazed carrot recipe for the Market patrons and assisting students as they transformed leafy, fresh kale into crispy kale chips.The Joyful Food Market at Moten is one of four pilot Markets currently operating in high needs schools in D.C.’s Ward 7 and 8. The Capital Area Food Bank also operates Family Markets, its original school pantry model, in 11 additional D.C. schools, seven schools in Maryland, and five schools in Northern Virginia.

This opened up an opportunity to discuss the need for an outdoor teaching space.Then, this past November, she approached the CAFB with the idea of collaborating on a project for the Greenbuild contest.  In record time, a team of CAFB staff, HKS architects and staff from Clark Construction put together an entry.  The innovative design incorporates edible plants, rainwater collection and solar power.  In addition to teaching equipment, it will house a small outdoor kitchen, where staff may conduct cooking demonstrations and nutrition education.On February 26th, team members from the CAFB, HKS and Clark attended the US Green Building Council’s Green Tie Affair, a networking event for local professionals involved in the green building industry.  The CAFB competed with three other finalists for votes from the attendees.  All of the finalists had worthy projects, but the voters ultimately chose the CAFB for the 2015 Legacy Project!As if that weren’t enough good news, the CAFB is also delighted to thank John and Diana Jaeger and YCRI for their generous donation of $26,000 to cover the additional construction costs for the classroom.  With the total costs covered, building will soon commence!Thanks goes out to the US Green Building Council for using this project to give back to the community at large, and to HKS Architects and Clark Construction for working with the CAFB to create a winning plan.  Check back later this year to see the classroom in action!", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

DC Regional Coordinator Amy Hedges convened leaders from CAFB’s Ward 7 food assistance partners for the “Fellowship and Food: Building Alliances among the Faith Based Pantries in Ward 7” panel which focused on collaborations between the CAFB and its partners.In 2014, CAFB partners in Ward 7 distributed over 601,000 pounds of food – which when divided into 30 pound bags means church volunteers handed a big bag of food to someone in need 20,000 times last year. Picture that!One panelist, Willie Clark of Pennsylvania Avenue Baptist, spoke to how grateful he was for the CAFB partnership, which he said “has given us a framework, and logic, for giving food. With their help, we’re not just pushing out food—we’re giving recipes and talking about health.”This increase in capacity was echoed by Muriel Francis of Redeemed Christian Church of God New Wine Assembly who offered, “We recently added a second distribution, and my organization has increased the amount we distribute by 107%. Overall, Ward 7 has increased the amount of food it’s distributing by 50%.”The panelists spoke of benefits that extend beyond the bags of food the CAFB makes available to its 500 food assistance partners. Ms. Francis stated, “Our clients love the recipes provided by CAFB. They’re realizing they need to dial back on the fried fish, the fatback. A lot of clients have said that they actually feel better.”One benefit of being not only a CAFB partner, but also part of the collaborative meetings the CAFB organizes across its service area, is the pooling of information. Yvonne Brown of Food & Clothing Center, Peace Lutheran said, “By being in the Ward 7 Collaborative, partners who didn’t already know about grants available were able to hear about them and apply.”Encouraging feedback usually comes with a request or two, and CAFB was there to listen. For example, Yvonne Scott of Church of the Incarnation, St. Vincent de Paul Society asserted that they would like the CAFB to deliver the free fruits and vegetables offered for pickup at its warehouse.Here at the food bank, we value this kind of feedback. If you are a CAFB food assistance partner and you haven’t heard about a collaborative near you,ask usso we have an excuse to see you more often and better serve your needs!We can tell you about our quarterly collaborative meetings for partners in Maryland; Prince Williams County, VA (with plans for an Alexandria city and Fairfax county collaborative meeting soon); and in Wards 7 and 8 in the District.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Founded in 1990 and located in Adams Morgan, Joseph’s House provides healing care to homeless and unstably housed men and women with advanced and end-stage AIDS and terminal cancer.Yesterday we made our inaugural shopping trip to the Capital Area Food Bank and I can’t wait to go back. Who knew food shopping could be this much fun!We began the application process to become a food bank partner some months back, and yesterday’s trip was confirmation of what a good idea that was. We stocked up on food and paper goods for the house at substantial savings. We were able to get a variety of meat that we can’t normally afford and the big heads of fresh greens just made us smile. The partnership with the food bank is allowing us to start a small food pantry for former residents who are struggling to eat well and we shopped with them in mind. We felt like kids who had scored special treats when we found jars of Skippy peanut butter and boxes of tasty soups.These benefits alone would make partnering with the food bank worthwhile, but there was something about the shopping experience itself that made it even better. The space is bright, clean and easy to navigate. Not luxurious or fancy, but very pleasant. From the minute we walked in, the staff members were welcoming and helpful, and the process smooth and efficient. They accommodate a lot of agencies and faith communities every day, and each interaction always came with a friendly, service-oriented spirit. I shouldn’t have been surprised since our interactions with the staff during the application process and the subsequent trainings have all been in that same spirit, but still it was refreshing.At Joseph’s House, we work hard to create a genuine sense of welcome for all who enter, and it was a pleasure to be on the other side of such a gracious welcome. It was also heartening to see the other groups shopping and picking up their orders – so many good folks doing day-to-day service to help people put food on their tables. Some days I get lost in my small world and I forget about all those out there in our city doing good work to feed, clothe, care for, and support those around us who are hurting. Solidarity feels nice.Our partnership with the food bank puts us in solidarity with over 500 local agencies. It’s an important step that will reduce our food costs and allow us to serve our friends in new ways. It also gives us the opportunity to be on the receiving end of the generosity of thousands of local residents, businesses, and faith communities who hold food drives, make donations, and volunteer at the food bank. Their spirit, too, infuses the shopping floor and that, I realized, is what makes shopping there such a joyful experience.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

This marks the Association’s second year of support to Family Markets and we are grateful for their continued commitment to those who suffer from hunger in the Washington metro region.Family Markets are monthly market-style distributions that provide over 150 children and families with 30-40 pounds of groceries, including shelf-stable items and fresh fruits and vegetables.  Formerly the School Pantry Program, Family Markets are located directly on school grounds in high-need areas, with 50% or more of children qualifying for free and reduced meals – most of the schools where Family Markets are operated have rates of 90% or higher.  Family Markets also offer cooking demonstrations, recipes, nutrition tips and other information to help families make better food choices.Hunger undermines a child’s ability to function and learn, and impacts their mental and physical development. Hunger is also inextricably linked to diet-related illnesses such as heart disease and high blood pressure among adults.

It was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who said, “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’” Since opening its doors on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s birthday in 1980, the Capital Area Food Bank has worked to honor his legacy by feeding anyone who needs food assistance.Thanks to a community of donors and volunteers, the Capital Area Food Bank has been able to sustain its work in ensuring the nearly 700,000 people at risk of hunger in the Washington metro area have access to healthful food. And this year, we are asking the community to team up and help us solve hunger.This may start sounding like a ploy to get you to click the donate button above.

During the sixth class session, participants are asked to reflect on the knowledge and skills learned throughout the course.  One participant commented “It’s made me more aware of what actual nutrition is all about. It’s taught me different ways to help incorporate healthy into every meal.”After reflecting on the class, I’ve found the level of passion from volunteers and participants to be incredibly inspiring. Glassmanor parents sought to truly understand how dietary quality affected their health and how to make changes to improve the health of their families. What made this course special and unique was the opportunity for mothers to bond with their children while learning how to cook together.  Through their involvement with the cooking lessons, children felt empowered to try the “scary and gross” vegetables on their plate and even asked for seconds of the various meals that were made – from barley and lentil soup to hearty egg burritos.Through my experience at Glassmanor, the impact Cooking Matters has on participants is immense. According to class members, the sessions helped them learn how to purchase more food on a budget and improve their family’s health through an increased awareness of their salt, sugar and fat consumption. At the end of graduation, participants sought final tips on ways to continue improving their food habits and those of their community members.Join us andlearn moreabout Cooking Matters or how you can become a volunteer teacher.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

I was overwhelmed with a sense of gratefulness, happy to be surrounded by so much love…and, so much good food. This happens every year; families come together over food and give thanks for all of their blessings. Sadly, with each passing day, there are hundreds of families in our community who gather together, give thanks for their blessings, but have no food to share.\nHunger is a reality that far too many of our friends, neighbors, and those we have yet to know, experience on a daily basis. The need in the Washington metro area is far greater than one could imagine with nearly 700,000 individuals and families suffering from food insecurity in our own backyard. Annually, over half a million people seek the services of the Capital Area Food Bank where they are able to receive access to healthy and fresh produce, meats, and more. Our network of 500 partner agencies gives us a broader reach to aide our neighbors in all of the District of Columbia, Northern Virginia, and Montgomery and Prince’s Georges Counties in Maryland. Our staff and volunteers work hard to serve those in need, but it is because of our kind, caring and generous donors that we are able to fill both the hearts and stomachs of those who are struggling with hunger.\nToday is#GivingTuesday, a global day dedicated to the true spirit of giving. Today, we express how thankful we are for our individual blessings, by giving back to our communities. Just $1 provides 2.5 meals to someone hungry.

Many seniors—an estimated 15,000 in the District alone—are missing nutrients essential to maintaining an active lifestyle because they don’t have enough food.“I usually eat one meal a day, maybe then I have some peanuts. On a good day, two meals, when I have an appetite,” said Preston L. Williams, who at 67, considers himself a young senior. A former law enforcement officer who was injured on the job, Williams is now retired and struggles to pay his Medicare payments. With his escalating medical bills, Williams has very little money left over for food.“I look at people and see, if their income is $26,000 [vs. the Washington area median income of $88,000] and you’ve got a kid, a wife, a car, food, medicine, gas for the car, then something’s going to have to balance it out, and it’s food. To end up with macaroni cheese is fine, but not every night,” he explained.  When Williams’ is short on food, he scrounges through his pantry, including his stash of canned goods. “I’ve had to step it down, but I’m not down to cat food. So I’m doing all right so far.”After surviving prostate cancer and thyroid cancer surgery, as well as a pulmonary embolism that left him hospitalized for 39 days, Williams’ attitude is “you can’t let it get you down, so you just make it through.”  He keeps his spirits up by gardening, but is often too weak to make it to the grocery store. So he, like roughly 6,000 others seniors in DC, turn to the Capital Area Food Bank’sGrocery Plus Program, which provides 30-40 pounds of healthy groceries monthly to seniors aged 60 or over who live in the District of Columbia and meet income guidelines.“I know that without this nutrition, it would be impossible. Having the food there, available, you gotta eat when you’re hungry. I don’t see how people do without it. You’ve gotta take care of your body. You’ve gotta eat greens, you’ve gotta eat fruit. It’s a really terrible situation to be in when people don’t have food. [Food] means a lot emotionally, it makes you feel connected.” For Williams, the food he receives through the CAFB isn’t just about nutrition, it’s about feeling supported by his community and able to navigate life’s curve balls with limited resources.The Capital Area Food Bank works endlessly so seniors are never faced with those types of decisions. This November is no different.We want to continue providing senior citizens in theBrown Bag Programwith a turkey and other Thanksgiving complements that typically make up this season’s delicious holiday meal. And, since many seniors are helping to support other family members, it is vital we have enough food for their families as well.Invest todayin the health and wellness of our seniors.

This way, if you have turkey leftovers, you’ll know what to do with them! Try adding chopped cilantro, green onion or fresh lime juice for an extra kick. If you have another kind of ground meat available, that can be substituted for the ground turkey. And of course, add more veggies (fresh, canned or frozen) in there if you have them. Chopped tomatoes, fresh or canned corn, and green peppers are all nice when added with the sweet potato.As you prepare for December’s holiday parties, consider trying ourPumpkin Breadas a lower sugar, lower fat alternative to holiday sweets. The whole wheat flour that’s used instead of the regular all-purpose stuff is high in fiber. Our recipe contains warming spices like cinnamon and allspice, but if your family’s pantry includes cardamom, cloves, or any others in your holiday tradition, try those and let us know how it goes!Finally, did you know that in the southern United States, eatingBlack Eyed Peas— Hoppin’ John– onNew Year’s Dayis believed to bring a prosperous year? Our recipe will get you ready for good fortune, and it’s a great way to eat the vegetables needed for a healthy diet in one low-salt dish.

United turned things around in quick time. Though they won last year’s U.S. Open Cup Championship, their league record hit a historic low. If D.C. United, one of Major League Soccer’s most accomplished teams, wanted back into the playoff picture, they needed to exorcise any lingering 2013 demons.And exorcise they did. This year, D.C. United are unstoppable. Thanks to the leadership of Coach Ben Olsen and contributions from players up and down the roster, D.C. United currently sits in first place in the Eastern Conference and only a few points away from winning the Supporters Shield (best record in MLS).Coming off a road win in Houston, D.C. United looks to continue to ride that success into Saturday’s matchup against the Chicago Fire. Though D.C. United has already clinched a playoff spot, this game has tremendous implications. For starters, it will ensure United wins the Eastern Conference. In addition, the 12thman has a huge opportunity to help so many at risk of hunger in the Washington metro area.The Capital Area Food Bank and D.C. United, through United Drives, will collect non-perishables before Saturday’s match. The CAFB/United Drives booth is located outside of RFK Stadium’s Gate A and will open an hour and a half prior to kickoff, closing 15 minutes into the first half.Any fan donating an item will receive a “Buy One, Get One Free” ticket voucher good for any 2015 D.C.

United offices on game and non-game days, located on the fourth floor of Gate A.Hoisting another Eastern Conference trophy is nice, but kicking out hunger is outstanding. Help the CAFB and D.C.

Handcrafted bowls were created by local artist and delicious soups were prepared by local chefs.It was very difficult to choose a bowl between the variety and beautiful handcrafted options.After browsing through the bowl selections, it was time to experience savory soups provided by the restaurants. All of the soups were tempting and delightful, and it became very difficult to just try one. So I decided to taste all of them and pair them with the fresh bread provided.  After all there was a Soup-er Bowl Challenge being held, in which guests got to vote on their favorite soup.   Guest speakers Jummy Olabanji from ABC 7 and Wessita McKinley, Founder of Sistas United, spoke to the importance of nutrition and how so many families in the Nation’s Capital go to bed hungry each day.All in all it was a great event for a great cause.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

No, it’s not by drones…yet. Quite simply, it is largely dependent on volunteers who help move the food in the CAFB’s distribution center on a daily basis!At the CAFB, volunteerism is equally as important as monetary support. Volunteers are needed to get nutritious meals from the food bank’s facilities into the homes of over 500,000 people. In the past year, the invaluable work of volunteers saved the CAFB $2.8 million in staffing costs.The need for volunteers, however, is still great. In the past few months, TONS of food was donated throughCanstructionand theFed Feeds FamiliesFood Drive. The CAFB is now challenged with getting the food quickly to its food assistance partners and more importantly to those in need.Yes, there will be a bit of picking things up just to put them back down, but the volunteer experience extends beyond simply sorting and packing. As Marian Barton Peele, senior director of partner relations and programs, points out in the video below, “What they are really doing is laying the foundation for health, wellness and education for thousands in the Washington, DC area.” Volunteering at the CAFB is an enriching experience, bringing together those who want to join a social movement and help solve hunger in the Washington metro area.Without the dedication and time of individuals, the CAFB would not be able to effectively reach those in need.Join the team at the CAFBand help nourish children, seniors and families at risk of hunger.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Choosing just one won’t be easy. Luckily, there is nothing stopping anyone from buying ten, twenty, thirty or even the whole lot. And why not? The holidays are right around the corner. Bowls make great gifts.A$25 contribution at this eventgoes a long way in the ongoing effort to solve hunger.

Many local students returned healthy and prepared for the school year, thanks to the Capital Area Food Bank’s child hunger programs. One such program, Family Markets, offers monthly market-style distributions of free fruits, vegetables, pasta, meat and other food items to children and families, providing up to 30 pounds of food primarily during the school year – with several regional distributions during the summer. Formerly the School Pantry Program, Family Markets are located directly on school grounds and allow families to shop for the food they want.Washington, D.C. has the second highest rate of child hunger in the nation, with one in three children at risk of hunger. In the Washington metro region, nearly 150,000 children struggle with hunger daily. Summer is especially challenging for many children and families in the region who rely on free and reduced meals but don’t have access to meals when school is closed. This is where the food bank picks up the ball, too, working with the USDA Summer Food Service Program to ensure that children and teens have access to healthy summer meals.  Employing multiple program strategies this way, the CAFB ensures that children are consistently accessing nutritious food necessary for their future physical and mental health, academic achievement and future economic productivity.“Family Markets and Summer Food Service work in tandem to contribute to the health and wellness in our communities, especially our children,” said Nancy E. Roman, Capital Area Food Bank President and CEO. “Hunger is at the root of so many important social developments and it undermines a strong society. If you’re hungry, you cannot learn. If you’re hungry you cannot grow into a healthy, productive adult.”Launched in 2011, Family Markets has so far distributed 1.3 million pounds of healthy groceries to local families.  With 20 Family Market sites currently around the Washington metro region, 2,250 families receive monthly distributions of healthy fresh produce and other foods while school is in session and during the summer at select schools. The program is offered at Bruce Monroe School, Simon Elementary, Orr Elementary, Ketcham Elementary, Ballou Senior High School, Anne Beers Elementary, Neval Thomas Elementary, Friendship Blow Pierce Academy, Hart Middle School and Leckie Elementary in DC; Charles Carroll Middle School, Burtonsville Elementary, Greencastle Elementary and Glassmanor Elementary in Maryland; and Bren Mar Park Elementary, Carlin Springs Elementary and West Gate Elementary in Northern Virginia.  This past May, the program expanded to Kennedy Cluster Schools in Montgomery County, which will offer seven schools the opportunity to participate.  Family Markets are made possible through the generous support of corporate and individual donors.“Family Markets are a great opportunity to get good, healthy food especially when you’re running low,” said Cynkithia Pelham, coordinator of Ketcham Elementary’ s Family Markets Program  and the school’s PTA President, who noted that many kids she serves have limited access to wholesome food. “Many times this is the only access to fresh produce that families will get and kids have to be fed.  We have a lot of need in our community and the two weeks’ worth of supplemental groceries that the food bank gives to families definitely helps.”  Pelham added that there is no stigma associated with picking up food since families can choose from an assortment of fresh fruits, vegetables and nonperishable items in a market-style environment.The CAFB offers additional programs that make sure children are well fed during school vacations, weekends and after school hours. The Kids Cafe program provides free, healthy meals to over 2,000 children and teens daily afterschool and over the summer; and is offered at sites such as community centers, apartment complexes, churches, and other organizations that provide youth enrichment activities. The food bank’s Weekend Bag program offers bags of healthy groceries to 1,792 children in need to ensure they have food to eat on the weekend; and the Fresh Produce Weekend Bag supplies children and families with fresh fruits and vegetables.The Capital Area Food Bank works tirelessly to improve the health and food security of those most vulnerable, children, at risk of hunger. The food bank’s child hunger programs help ensure access to quality, nutritious meals throughout the year and give the next generation a healthy start to their future.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

In the 1990s, when Kids Cafe was just a gleam in the food bank’s eye, the dilemma centered on just how popular food bank leadership knew the program would be once it was launched. The food bank did not want to start a program that our clients would quickly come to depend on unless we knew we could keep it going and know that as it grew, we could sustain it.Capital One stepped in and for many years was the largest single financial supporter ofKids Cafe, annually providing grant funds of over $77,000 to provide the stability the program demanded. The program is now a secure neighborhood resource with a stable track record of service, serving over 2,600 children at 65 sites around the Washington metro region and has attracted many supporters. Capital One has continued to support child hunger programs at the CAFB, shifting its focus to Weekend Bag and now to Family Markets, a program modeled on a school pantry, but with a client-choice market flavor.With its innovative giving model and hands-on volunteer spirit, concentrating resources across community service programs and organizations in one neighborhood location, Capital One continues to earn the gratitude of the CAFB and many of its food assistance partners.Capital One generously supported the food bank’s capital campaign and provides general operating funds through short term projects such as the food bank’s Good Neighbor Corporate campaign and the recent Capital One generated Food Truck event, highlighting one of the District’s favorite lunch options with a food bank twist. These and other creative community engagement aspects of its involvement have meant that Capital One has provided over one and a half million dollars in support to the food bank during a long and productive relationship.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Settles established in his long career of non-stop giving.Established in 1968 by Rev. Settles,Ambassador Baptist Churchgrew to be an integral part of the Anacostia community with a first-of-its-kind 24-hour food distribution center; licensed Day Care Center; community residence facility; an annex; a Christian School for children – Kindergarten through grade eight; and several rental properties  that were used as emergency housing  for church members.Rev. Settles partnered with the CAFB in 1989 and distributed over a million pounds to residents in need – averaging 22,500 pounds monthly.  He didn’t limit his services to Southeast residents but served anyone who needed food. A true pillar of the community, Rev. Settles played a critical role in helping the CAFB fulfill its mission to feed people struggling with hunger throughout the Washington metro region.Anyone who ever met him has their own vivid personal recollection.  “In my early tenure, Marian Peele and I drove out on March 21, 2013 to pay Rev. Settles a visit.  His health had begun to decline and he was in a recliner in his living room.  He lit up the room with stories of his work in the government, the early building of his church and his passion for helping those less fortunate.  We sat for an hour or so, listening to his stories.  You could sense his passion and his optimism and his strong belief in helping those without.  As he talked about his commitment, he was overcome by emotion.   The time with Reverend Settles flew and he’d given me a gift I won’t forget.” –Nancy Roman, President and CEO“I met Rev. Settles soon after starting at the food bank 24 years ago.  He supported me both personally and professionally.  If I needed anything, Rev. Settles always said yes.  Similarly, when Rev. Settles asked for anything, I always said yes.  He never requested anything for himself, it was always for others.  Once I called Rev. Settles at 7:30 pm on a Friday evening.  I had received a call from a gentleman who needed food.  He worked the late shift and he just couldn’t go home without food for his family.  He didn’t get off work until midnight.  I called Rev. Settles and asked if I could send the gentleman to him, even though he wouldn’t arrive at Ambassador until 12:30 am.  Rev. Settles simply replied, “Tell him to come, I’ll be here.”  –Marian Peele, Sr. Director of Partner and ProgramsReverend Roy Settles left the world peacefully and quietly on Friday, July 25, 2014.  His passion for helping others lives on throughout the Washington metro region, in the lives of Anacostia residents and the in the heart and work of the Capital Area Food Bank.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Both army veterans, the couple traveled all over the country searching for jobs and a home they could afford, often times staying with friends and family, in hotels when they had the money, and finally in their car.  Epiphaney left the army in 2007 when their first son was born, and Humberto was discharged in 2011. He took culinary arts classes in the different cities they visited, but home prices were out of the couple’s price range.“We just weren’t able to find a place we could afford,” said Epiphaney.  After first meeting in Washington, DC, they went on to work in San Diego, from there moved to North Carolina and Virginia, and finally returned to DC this spring to be near family and the Art Institute, where Humberto is enrolled in the culinary arts program.  Epiphaney studies forensic psychology at St. Augustine University and wants to ultimately help child victims of crime.Here in DC, they foundCentral Union Mission’s Food PLUS Center, one of the Capital Area Food Bank food assistance partners, through a resource listing. “We are so glad we came,” said Epiphaney. “At the Food PLUS Center, you’re not just a number. They gave us a hug, we talked together, cried together. It’s more than just getting some free food. The people have great hearts and were telling us, ‘You are down now, but you can get up.’”The Gittens’ new two-bedroom apartment, located in a gated building, allowed for the couple’s three boys – ages 7, 5 and 2 – to have their own bedroom to share. Epiphaney and Humberto want to eventually open a restaurant in their Anacostia neighborhood, but in the meantime, they are all about cooking meals at home and making healthy green smoothies for their boys.The Gittens’ involvement with Central Union Mission’s Food PLUS Center has allowed them to become a part of the organization’s family in a deeper way.  Deborah Chambers, Director of Strategic Partnerships and Community Engagement at Central Union Mission, helped secure many rooms’ worth of furniture for their new home. Chambers also hired Epiphaney for a part-time office job, and Humberto as a part-time cook for the summer camp. She hopes to help them find full-time employment soon.The Capital Area Food Bank’s network of food assistance partners provides valuable services to their clients, as evidenced by Central Union Mission’s work with the Gittens family.  The Gittens story is a powerful example of how the CAFB and its partners help reduce hunger and empower individuals in need throughout the Washington metro region.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Yeah, you, the guys and gals who are already starting to feel guilty because your only alternative to a grueling Labor Day road trip to see grandma might instead be plopping the kids in front of the television for hours on end.It doesn’t have to play out that way  – at least not for a few hours – because a wholesome, free diversion is right around the corner.Introducing Canstruction!  Yes, that is spelled correctly. No, this isn’t a blog post trying to introduce your kids to the thrills of driving rebar with a rotary hammer.Canstruction is a family friendly exhibition at the National Building Museum where your kids can marvel at massive structures made out of non-perishables. Every year, teams of architects and engineers are provided a central theme and have to erect a monument out of “building supplies” they obtained from Safeway and other grocers.And what is this year’s Canstruction theme? …Wait for it… “Play With Your Food!“  Yep, it gets kid friendlier with each line.All Canstructions were designed and built to relate to the Building Museum’s architectural toy collection. Twenty-eight structures resembling toys and games fill the entire east side of the museum.Perhaps you might also be interested in piling on a civics lesson in the process. There’s no better way to teach kids about voting irregularities than to have them act it out at the Canstruction “ballot boxes.”People are encouraged to “vote” by donating non-perishables to their favorite Canstructions. Folks can vote multiple times and for as many teams as they like.  All those votes will ultimately go on to become meals for those in the Washington metro area at risk of hunger.So, familiarize with theBuilding Museum schedule, load up the wagon with food, and treat the fam to a fun-filled architectural experience.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

We were so overwhelmed by their gratitude for the programs, and boy did they have a lot to share with us about their lives and personal relationships with food and cooking.Many seniors are on a fixed income and receive the minimum SNAP benefit. They are out of work, retired or disabled, and rely on emergency food assistance to make sure they have enough food for themselves and their families each month. Our Senior Brown Bag and Grocery Plus programs provide monthly groceries to seniors who qualify. Through these programs, we are able to serve over 9,800 seniors in DC, Maryland and Northern Virginia. The programs, however, provide more than a bag of healthy food like grains, beans, protein and fresh vegetables each month. One aspect the seniors love most about the Grocery Plus program is the vouchers they get for free farmers market produce in the summer.The most amazing thing we heard from the listening session participants was how much they love helping each other! Since many of them live in the same buildings, they help each other by sharing the meals they cook with family and friends, as well as cooking tips, and the ways they’ve learned to stretch their food budget over the years. Even though our seniors are working hard to make ends meet, they still want to give back. Many asked about volunteer opportunities and ways they can help. We listened, and have started to engage some of the seniors in opportunities here at the food bank. Since shyness is not an issue with most of these seniors, many are willing to share their stories in their community to promote hunger awareness and increase participation in our programs.We also learned that seniors want to eat healthy. The foods they want more than any others are kale and other greens, apples, bananas, chicken, turkey, beef and fish. It’s clear that our work is to make these healthy foods, which are more expensive than processed or carb-heavy foods, available to seniors who have limited food budgets. We also learned that they all appreciate our newsletter –Bag it Up!– which is included with the food and offers simple recipes, food handling guidelines and other health tips.We are always looking for ways to reach more seniors through our programs and to provide healthy, nutritious foods to those in need. The Capital Area Food Bank is committed to strengthening the seniors in our region and empowering them to be a voice in their communities.

Those smiles may look friendly to some, but the determination and drive in their eyes is unmistakable.The ABC Washington Student Chapter, however, is not the only team looking to frighten competitors. Cooper Carry, which is designing a Cansculpture based off of Mario Kart, wrote the following on its fundraising page:“Whena times get tough, I pushes through witha mah mushroom acceleration, and launch mah green turtle shell and banana peel at anyone who will stand in mah way to win the race, and beat hunger! Ima gonna wiiiiiiiiin!”Not only has Cooper Carry fully embraced the personality behind its Canstruction design, but it has also strategized several effective methods of weaning off opponents. There is no question that the team plans on taking home at least one of the six sought-after Canstruction awards this year.While both of the aforementioned teams have taken to their respectivefundraising pagesto instill fear in competitors, it should be noted that several teams have refrained from utilizing online self-promotion—a strategy that could lead to some major surprises come build-day on August 23.Strategy and preparation are important, but teams are going to have to rely on the support from Canstruction and Building Museum enthusiasts if they want to even come close to winning the People’s Choice Award.

Headquartered on 14thStreet in Northwest DC, the organization takes innovative approaches to addressing hunger as evidenced in its healthy grocery markets, named Martha’s Markets, in eight elementary schools in the District and Prince Georges County where at least 75 percent of students qualify for free or reduced lunch.  Martha’s Table’s latest program, in collaboration with Arcadia Center for Sustainable Food and Agriculture, is a weekly summer mobile farm-market for underserved families with children at those same schools.  At the Martha’s Table-Arcadia roving market, families choose from a variety of free and for-sale farm-fresh produce from Arcadia’s farms and shelf-stable foods that are, primarily, from the Capital Area Food Bank. Market-goers can also enjoy cooking demonstrations, information and tastings.What you may not realize is that beyond the summer, the CAFB provides most of the food that Martha’s Table distributes, making it possible for Martha’s Markets to reach as many families in DC as possible. The food bank provided over 25,000 pounds of free fresh produce to Martha’s Table throughout the 2013-2014 school year, saving the organization an estimated $26,000. Through the CAFB’s administering of the USDA’s Emergency Food Assistance Program in DC, Martha’s Table received over 110,000 pounds of food—from frozen chicken to fresh tomatoes to dry cereal—free of charge during the past school year.The food bank addresses hunger in the Washington area through its network of 500 food assistance partners. Many of these partners pick up food at the CAFB’s distribution center to serve clients in their own pantries, in sites that range from churches to residential buildings. Martha’s Table, however, takes their show on the road and the food bank actually delivers directly to their Martha’s Markets to make their efforts possible.“Our vibrant partnership with CAFB has allowed our Martha’s Markets to double the number of families we serve in the District and PG County this year,” says Martin Booker, Director of Food and Nutrition Services at Martha’s Table. “It is a testament to CAFB’s tenacity and creativity in sourcing that our families can take home grocery bags filled with as much as 40 percent of fresh produce each month. CAFB’s donations also help us provide more healthful meals to our after-school and early-childhood education students and McKenna’s Wagon customers.”With strong leadership from President and CEO Patty Stonesifer and Booker, the food bank is working alongside Martha’s Table to strengthen the hunger safety net, together, across the Washington metro area.  The operation of Martha’s Markets in eight high-need DC schools coupled with the CAFB’s Family Markets, helps to ensure that every DC family has access to nutritious ingredients, no matter their means. –Kirsten Bourne, Director of Partners & Programs EngagementIn this column, we share the stories of our food service partners. Each year, the Capital Area Food Bank distributes over 30 million pounds of food through direct distributions and a network of more than 500 partner agencies throughout the Washington metro area, serving over 400,000 people struggling with hunger.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

And what a service Washington Nationals second baseman Anthony Rendon provided for his teammates! Rendon,who volunteered at the CAFB last summer, delivered an MVP performance by driving in a few runs, including a three-run homer, while also helping shut out the Phillies.Though starting pitcher Jordan Zimmerman delivered a commanding performance by allowing no runs in seven innings, relievers Jerry Blevins and Blake Treinen also deserve praise. Blevins,who taught children how to make a healthy salsa at the CAFB, took to the mound in the eighth and helped preserve the shut out.On Sunday, it was starting pitcher Stephen Strasburg’s turn to frustrate the Phillies’ batters.

Our Family Foundation has contributed to meals for more than 3,220 children enrolled in four main food bankchildhood feeding programs; Kids Cafe, Weekend Bag, Weekend Bag Fresh Produce and the Summer Food Service Program.

Thanks to Giant and Our Family Foundation’s two years of grant awards for year-round child hunger programs, the food bank’s participation in theSummer Food Service Program (SFSP)as a sponsor can go forward, reaching over 2,500 children all summer long.During this same time, Giant Food donated a 26-foot refrigerated tractor-trailer in 2013, a $94,000 donation resulting from Giant’s Checkout Hunger Giving Campaign, and many outright donations of food to the CAFB. These include 1,000 turkeys for the holidays this past November, 1,838 pounds of premium hams, 9,679 pounds of apples just in the last three months, and a burgeoning store donation program providing 88,000 pounds of frozen meat to the food bank since September, 2013. This program will only grow as more Giant Food stores in the metro area join the food bank’s store donation or retail pick-up program, and as the CAFB’s capacity to collect in the area continues to grow.Giant Food at Landover has been there for the CAFB and for the children and families we serve for most of the food bank’s 34 year history.  Our Family Foundation’s Fighting Child Hunger is just one example of a partnership that continues to make better the lives of those most vulnerable, our children, at risk of hunger in our community.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Sounds tricky, right? Now imagine solving those equations on an empty stomach. Just the thought of doing so may cause a bit of discomfort. Unfortunately, for the 200,000 children and teens at risk of hunger in the Washington metro area, this scenario is a reality and leads to problems much more serious than a little discomfort.Numerousstudiesshow that hungry children have lower math scores and are more likely to be hyperactive and late to, or absent, from school. Further evidence indicates that children suffering from hunger are more likely to be suspended from school and repeat a grade.To ensure that children receive nutritious meals daily, the Capital Area Food Bank hosts monthly Family Markets at select schools, where fresh produce and non-perishable goods are distributed to approximately 100 families free of charge. Information about educational resources and community support services is also distributed at Family Markets. Family Markets provide kids with the energy and support they need to stay in school, focus, and yes—even solve the toughest algebra equations.Family Markets play an important role throughout the Washington metro area, but there are always more communities, more families and more kids that need support. The CAFB wants to expand the Family Market program and needs your help.This July, the CAFB is asking the community to donate what is normally spent on lunch to its annualSkip Lunch, Solve HungerCampaign,to help raise enough money to cover the costs of a single Family Market. By donating, you can help feed kids struggling with hunger in your community.Throughout the entire month of July, Shoppers Food & Pharmacy will match each individual donation up to a maximum of $10,000.

It provides nutrition and academic support to 2,500 children daily to help them reach their full potential.Luckily for Sydney, the Harvey Hall program will continue this summer when school is out of session, so she can continue learning, growing and realizing her dreams. Watch the Harvey Hall Program in action!During the summertime, however, many families struggle to feed their children when they don’t have access to free and reduced school lunch programs. According to Share Our Strength, a nonprofit aiming to end childhood hunger, low-income families spend an average of $300 more per month on food during the summer months when kids are out of school. Nearly 200,000 children and teens are at risk of hunger in the Washington metro region; and 1 in 3 children in the District struggles to get enough food to eat.To respond to this need, the CAFB stepped up its support to children and families by participating in the summer meal program.  In partnership with state agencies and with support from the USDA Summer Food Service Program, the food bank will host 23 summer meal sites in the District of Columbia, 24 in Northern Virginia and 27 in Maryland to feed more than 2,500 children daily.In addition to the summer meal program, the food bank participates in the Fresh Produce Grant, a farm program that connects 10 partner agencies with 4,000 pounds of high-quality produce from Claggett Farm and Waterpenny Farm.Community partners also help the CAFB address the summer meal gap.  Top DC attorneys, including Former U.S. Attorney General and Governor of Pennsylvania Dick Thornburgh, participated in a month-long competition led by the Washington legal community to raise food and funds for the Capital Area Food Bank. With help from over 30 local law firms, law schools and legal organizations,  the annual Food From The Bar campaign raised over $130,000. Proceeds will help provide over 300,000 meals for residents in need.“The Food From the Bar campaign embodies how working together as a legal community can yield the opportunity to feed thousands of our friends and neighbors when they are most in need,” says Dick Thornburgh, K&L Gates Counsel and Honorary Chairman of the 2014 D.C.

We partner with a variety of sites, including community centers, low-income housing centers and Boys & Girls Clubs.

We strive to provide a variety of interesting and healthy meals, meeting and often exceeding the national nutrition regulations that are a mandate of this program, so that we can satisfy kids’ appetites while also introducing new healthy options.Free summer meals are nationally underutilized, so we’re working hard to connect these meals with the kids who need them.

Neighbors can greet each other while browsing fresh, local produce, baked goods, cheeses and other staples cultivated by regional farmers and local artisans. Throughout the Washington metro area, particularly in the District, farmer’s markets are plentiful thanks to the increased demand for local produce by a booming population of food conscious consumers.The demand for produce spans all income brackets, yet the proliferation of farmer’s markets does not mean increased access to fresh produce for all. For many low-income DC residents, the cost and accessibility of fresh produce is a deterrent that makes this dietary staple a fleeting luxury.To address this issue, the Capital Area Food Bank will launch its DC Community Marketplace on Saturday, June 7 at the 100 block of L Street, NW (between New Jersey Avenue and First Street, NW).   The Marketplace will provide low-income families in the District with 30 pounds of monthly produce in a farmer’s market setting. Located in the heart of DC and in a high-needs community, the Community Marketplace will also serve as a hub where residents can learn about continuing education, job placement, and health and housing services, among others, available to them at little or no cost. Within walking distance of a library, school, and recreation center, the Marketplace encourages children and families to shop, learn and play together while reinforcing the importance of healthy eating.The CAFB will partner with the neighboring Farm at Walker Jones, an emerging urban farm that is operated by DC Greens, to receive produce cultivated by Walker Jones’ students.This is the CAFB’s first Community Marketplace in the District. The other two food bank operated Marketplaces are in Reston, VA and Lanham, MD. The DC Community Marketplace will operate every first Saturday of the month, year-round from 10 AM-12 PM.The food bank is proud to offer this service to residents of Washington, DC.  As a family gathers around a table, so too does a community unite around food.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

What you may not realize is that the USDA has a similar program for seniors which the Capital Area Food Bank has been operating in DC for nearly two years.The Grocery Plus Program provides a monthly grocery supplement to low income seniors to help stretch their already taxed fixed incomes. Participants receive nearly thirty pounds of nutritious food which meets their specific dietary needs including healthy canned protein and dairy, whole grains, low sodium vegetables, and low added sugar fruit. The grocery mix encourages seniors to cook from scratch and many choose tomake the ingredients their own.Providing nutritious food to a food insecure senior population is critical. The adverse health effects of food insecurity are magnified for seniors.  Food insecure seniors have significantly worse health outcomes than food secure seniors. They are 50% more likely to be diabetic, three times more likely to suffer from depression, and 60% more likely to have heart failure or experience a heart attack.The DC Grocery Plus Program is unique among jurisdictions in that it is administered in tandem with the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program, which provides participants with an annual fresh produce voucher to be redeemed at participating local farmers markets.  For many, the farmers market vouchers serve as a major incentive to participate in the Grocery Plus program.  In recognition of the significant demand for fresh produce, at the end of May the Capital Area Food Bank will begin providing fresh produce on an ongoing basis to its two Grocery Plus clinic sites. Each participant who picks up their food at a Grocery Plus clinic will have an option to take fresh produce and produce-focused nutrition education will be provided.The Capital Area Food Bank administers Grocery Plus on behalf of the DC Office on Aging (DCOA). Through the partnership with DCOA, the Capital Area Food Bank is able to expand the realm of resources that can be provided to at-risk seniors. Congregate meal programs, home delivered meals, and transportation assistance are all available to ensure that DC meets its goal of being “Age Friendly.”More nutritious foods in the hands of seniors means seniors, like students, remain active and engaged. It’s time we give back to those who have given so much, the true experts in the school of life.For more information on the Grocery Plus Program, please call 202-644-9880 or emailcsfp@capitalareafoodbank.org.

High cortisol levels are associated with elevated blood sugars and decreased bone density.When you’re struggling with hunger over the long term, your body is pumping out a ton of cortisol and can cause dysregulation of its release.  This may lead to increased risk for your health and heart.\nIn the Netherlands, during the end of World War II, millions of people were affected by a forced food embargo imposed by invading Germans. The finite period of starvation in a previously well nourished population provided a once in a generation window for scientists to study the effects of hunger. The study that followed — dubbed theDutch famine study— provided a glimpse into the lasting effects of hunger.It found that hunger didn’t affect everyone equally. Compared to their siblings, those who experienced hunger in utero had a greater risk of developing diabetes, heart disease, depression, and schizophrenia. These effects persisted not just for those people affected by the famine, but also for their children and grandchildren. These multigenerational effects were mediated by epigenetic changes – literally changes in how we express our DNA.So what does this mean? The study showed that even transient periods of hunger during crucial developmental stages will change how our genes are expressed. And the effect can persistent for generations.\nIn the United States, processed foods are moreaffordable than whole, natural foods. And here’s why: The government provides agricultural subsidies to keep certain food prices low.Corn, soybean, wheat, and dairy receive the most support. But keeping these crops cheap doesn’t exactly fall in line with efforts to eat more fruits and vegetables. Meanwhile, agricultural subsidies keep prices low for high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil.“We’re giving the worst possible options to the people who need it most,” Greg said. “Based on governmental policies, we’ve made the unhealthiest food the cheapest.”\nIn 2008, the American Journal of Public Health released a study about the food shopping habits oflow-incomewomen. Participants received $10 vouchers a week for shopping at local farmers’ markets. Eventually, the women started buying more servings of fruits and vegetables, and after the six month study – as well as the subsidies – ended, many continued to buy more produce.There are ways to reduce the risk for heart disease among those who are hungry — whether it’s through shopping incentives, gardening projects, or governmental policy.Want to find ways to help?Donatewhole grains, beans, and healthy cereals at a local food bank near you.This post was first published on 2Armadillos.com.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

So, when our friends at Giant told us they wanted to donate 250 cases of apples to the Capital Area Food Bank, we were thrilled!The apples will be distributed to our food assistance partners throughout Washington, D.C., suburban Maryland and Northern Virginia, who are all working on the frontline of hunger relief.

Giant recently contributed a truck to help the CAFB get more food into the community. During the holidays, they offer pre-packaged food boxes that customers can purchase for families in need. Additionally, Giant hosts one of the CAFB’s largest, annual food drives – Stuff-A-Truck.This apple donation comes at an important time as we prepare for our 2014 Capital Area Food Bank Hunger Summit, which focuses on food for health. The CAFB team has been working hard to assemble an impressive array of speakers who will share their knowledge about food, health and nutrition, and how it relates to the work that we are doing throughout the Washington metro region.

No, it wasn’t in the form of 18 different kinds of hors d’oeuvres he devoured at Blue Jeans Ball. Rather, his restful slumber was attributed to the generous contributions provided by Blue Jeans Ball attendees so he may go and acquire additional double-deep reach trucks — essentially, an awesome fork lift.\nThe 11th Annual Blue Jeans Ball grossed over $429,000, making it one of the most successful to date.\nMore than 760 people donned their denim wear and showed up to the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel yesterday evening to party and support the largest hunger relief organization in Washington metro area. As guests piled into the grand ballroom, they were greeted to an array of culinary delights from 40 of the area’stop restaurants.\nIf folks weren’t chomping down salads, sliders, and other hors d’oeuvres; then they were likely rocking out to John Jaeger’s The Elastic Waist Band or turning their attention to their silent auction bidding device.\nAnd then, drum solo.

I’m an 8th grader at Friends Community School in College Park MD. I am doing my year-end project on accessing affordable, healthy foods in low income neighborhoods.\nAs a service project I volunteered for the CAFB at Glassmanor Elementary School, taking pictures of the staff biting into apples for the “Hear the Crunch” campaign. The biting of the apples represents the importance of people eating healthily and that children should have access to affordable, healthy foods.\nMost of the school children were eating healthy lunches through the free lunch program. Their choices included spaghetti with meat sauce, broccoli, mixed vegetables, oranges, apple sauce, salad and milk.The children at Glassmanor Elementary School were so cute and the adults were so fun to work with. They all supported children eating healthy meals and were enthusiastic about participating in the campaign.In the state of Maryland 13.4% of residents and 19% of children are food insecure; and in Prince George’s County 15.6% of residents and 11.4% of children are food insecure. Food insecurity is defined as limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways.From this project I gained new-found appreciation for eating healthy and helping others to eat healthy.

We got no skew-oooool!”That’s the type of clamor many parents awoke to this morning as Washingtonians were greeted with a blanket of snow that shut down schools, services and businesses.After parents wrenched themselves free from their children’s excitement, they begin to try and figure out what to do next. For many moms and dads, the main priority is just keeping kids preoccupied with activities so they’re not getting into trouble. However, for many others families, that concern is coupled with the loss of free or reduced-price meals their kids’ schools were going to provide.School closures are a burden for almost everyone. Yet, they are extremely problematic for families that rely on schools to feed their children throughout the day. Without those meals, parents who already live on tight budgets have to scramble to nourish their children with very short notice.The ramifications can be great. Some might lose a day’s income or have to take time off work – yes, there are brave people working today – to watch their children. Others may not be as flexible and have to leave their kids at home with whatever food is left in the cupboard. Ultimately, closures affect quality and/or quantity of meals children receive.And for a region unaccustomed to multiple heavy snow falls in a given year, closures have taken an insurmountable toll on meals provided. D.C. Public Schools had justone snow day allocated this year. They are now on their fourth!  Some counties in Northern Virginia and Maryland are nearly into double digits.Can we control the weather? Of course not. However, we can ensure kids are well fed regardless of weather conditions.The Capital Area Food Bank regularly works to alleviate family food shortages through our programs such as Weekend Bags and Family Markets. These efforts regularly supplement families with healthy, nutritious food throughout the year. But, we hope to do more as demand increases, as it will with these closures.Before throwing on your snow boots and running to grab your child’s sled out of the basement, please take a minute tohelp us expand our coverage by making a contribution.

Foreigners are often shocked when he talks about our nation.Some of his work revolves around child and maternal health, of which nutrition is a key factor in healthy development.“I mention that food and nutrition are also problems in the U.S., and that in our capital region, there are half a million people in need of food assistance. [People] cannot believe that in America there are mothers, children and families who go to bed hungry, and that under-nutrition is a problem here,” he says.“When I first moved to Washington, DC, 20 years ago, I began donating food to the Capital Area Food Bank. After working overseas for seven years, I returned to Washington and became more involved with direct financial giving,” he says.The retired medical school professor and global health consultant says the more he learns about hunger in our region, the stronger he feels about the issue.“The need is beyond most people’s imagination.  The need covers a very wide array of individuals and families, including working people who cannot meet the nutritional needs of their families and need periodical supplemental help, to those in dire conditions – the elderly on minimal assistance, the sick and disabled and those who lost their jobs in the economic crisis.  Some people need assistance for a few months, others for a sustained period of time,” noting he finds the numbers shocking.But Andrew’s generosity of food donations and monetary gifts is now taking on a new form. He has decided to include the Capital Area Food Bank in his future and in his memory.“Food and nutrition needs are not going away, definitely not in my lifetime.  With my financial advisor, I selected an annuity whose core investment was unlikely to be used, as it creates the income I need without touching the deposited amount,” he says. “Since food is so important to me, it’s comforting to know that after I pass on, my investment in the CAFB will continue.”Andrew’s personal convictions, along with the tools from the CAFB website and the input of his financial advisor made his decision crystal clear.“When I was a university student, there were times I could not afford a lot of food. Peanut butter and tuna fish were my normal diet. I always thought that one of the most important advantages to completing my education would be to have whatever food I wanted,” he recalls. “To me, food was always the luxury I wanted, even more than a fancy home or car.  Food shouldn’t be a luxury, but for many Americans such things as fresh fruits and vegetables are a luxury out of their reach.”An annuity is essentially a multi-purpose insurance contract terminating in a payment stream.  In this case, Andrew made a decision to include the CAFB as a beneficiary of his annuity in his will – a  decision that will undoubtedly help the food bank nourish children and families for years to come.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

And because the honey is hyper local, it is both yummy and great for those suffering from allergies!“The bees at the food bank are thriving, hunkered down for the winter after a busy season collecting pollen and nectar from the Demonstration Garden,” Hill explains. “In turn, they helped the food bank grow as many fruits and vegetables as possible and have done a great job demonstrating to others how they, too, can use bees to achieve unbelievably high yields in their own gardens.”\n“It’s fantastic. I think the amount we have accomplished in just nine months is incredible. I think it is going to be one of the most impressive gardens in the city,” Crom says.The goal is to have the whole garden under cultivation for the 2015 growing season.We make the most of Washington, DC’s growing season – our garden is harvested from late spring until late fall. We take the wide variety of food and either distribute it through our agency mart or use it in our cooking demonstrations and workshops — we hold at least three of those each season. And some of them are held right in the garden!OurGrow Your Ownworkshop helps partner agencies that work with young children. We teach them how to share the love for fresh, healthy food by showing them how easy it can be to start any size garden — from backyard to balcony.TheBang for Your Buckworkshop is our way of helping partner agencies focus on low-cost gardening. It doesn’t have to cost a lot in supplies and soil to grow foods that might otherwise be expensive if they were buying it in a grocery store.Container Gardeningis another very popular workshop. Not everyone has green space for even a small garden, yet there are so many varieties of healthy fruits, vegetables and herbs that can be grown in containers — and most people have a window sill they can use as a small container garden!And our plans are not stopping there. Construction has already begun for our new greenhouse, which will help extend the growing season, and also prep seedlings for partner agencies who want to grow their own gardens, but need a little help in those very first stages.We are working to improve our drainage and even installing a rain garden. A rain garden is our way of using all the excess rain water, and using it to bolster deep-rooted plants that do well in wet soil and will make good use of the extra water.It’s no wonder our work gets rave reviews.“The typical reaction I get from people who visit our garden? They are blown away by how unique it is to have a healthy growing space like the one we have at the food bank,” Crom says.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

They receive recipes and, sometimes, teaching demonstrations.  So far the feedback is terrific.  Both the kids and the parents like the access to fresh food and information about how to prepare it.  The schools are telling us that it is increasing parent-participation in school activities.The Capital Area Food bank plans to expand from our current  five Family Mareket sites to a total of 16 sites  by June 2014, providing up to 96,000 pounds a month to 3,200 families with school-aged children.This grant will make a big difference in two schools – one in Anacostia and another in Prince William County.  Ketcham Elementary  in Southeast Washington with 270 students has a new principal, Maisha Riddlesprigger, who is ensuring that ninety families are now receiving food assistance through the market.The second school is West Gate Elementary School in Manasses, VA across the bridge from a housing complex that has homes occupied by two and three generations of family members including West Gate Bulldog students.  On its first food distribution in November, the school served over 150 families, most of which came from across the bridge.Through  partnerships with conveniently-located schools,  parents will be able to access fresh food and learn how to prepare it for their families – essential for learning and growth.This local award to the Capital Area Food Bank is the latest phase ofFill the Plate, Morgan Stanley Foundations’s  long-standing partnership withFeeding America, the nation’s leading hunger-relief charity.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Washington DC has the nation’s second highest rate of food insecurity among children.  One in three children in Washington DC lives in a home where there simply is not enough food for them to eat.  That means they go to bed hungry. They wake up hungry. They go to school hungry.The other is how there are still some people who just don’t understand the face of hunger — who hunger really affects.You would think that with relentless economic uncertainty in the news, and the common knowledge that our economy has been taking a beating, that stereotypes would be broken.  But the truth of the matter is, a lot of people think that if someone is hungry, it is because they are homeless, lazy or don’t work hard enough.  That couldn’t be further from the truth.Those suffering from hunger today are working full-time jobs and yet still can’t make ends meet because of frozen salaries, high rent, and entire families to feed. These peopleareearning an income – they’re working hard! They’re just not getting a break.That’s the bad news, the sad reality. And trust me, in the news business, we have enough of that.The annual Stuff-A-Truck event, however, changes all of that for me – both in tone, and in outcome. It’s an awesome, positive, feel-good event that produces incredible results.Members of the community who come out to the different Giant Stores to give food or funds are amazing. They give their time, they give their money – and they give their heart. I say that because I meet people who count their blessings and in turn hope to bless someone else in need.Kids helping kidsEvery year, a group of adorable children pulls into the Giant Store parking lot in their school bus, streaming out with their bagged donations in hand. They are from Beverly Farms, part of the Montgomery Child Care Association.When I see them, and how generous and thankful their little hearts are, it reminds me that we should ALL be giving, even just a little.Sometimes I worry that people figure that if they can’t give a lot, then they just won’t give at all. But that’s not true.  After all, when you calculate that a $1 donation translates into almost three meals, any amount you can share makes a big difference.If you watch me reporting every morning on the early shift for Fox5 Morning News, you know just how much I appreciate my coffee – I am always referring to it because it helps me wake up at 3am!And yet, I often remind myself that if everyone skipped just one $4 cup of coffee, and donated that indulgence to the Capital Area Food Bank, that small gesture would provide well over ten meals for those in need.The Capital Area Food Bank feeds 500,000 neighbors every year who struggle to meet their basic needs for food.I’m looking forward to reporting live from theStuff-A-Truck event on Friday, December 13(thanks to photographer Mike Rickard and truck engineer Max Giammetta!) because I get to encourage others to help make someone’s day just a little easier. And that warms my heart.Holly Morris is an Emmy Award-winning anchor and reporter with Fox 5 Morning News.

At each of the four corners, there is usually a person standing in the median strip, or weaving in and out of  cars stopped at traffic lights, with a handwritten, cardboard sign.\nSometimes I can read the words, and sometimes they are too faint to read. Often, there are just a few words such as: “Please help me. I need money for food. I am homeless.” Once in a while, the person has more details such as the man who had a large picture of a pregnant woman and asked that drivers contribute money for toys for his new baby when it’s born as well as food for his pregnant wife.\nSometimes, drivers roll down their windows to donate a couple of dollars or give someone a sandwich. Most drivers keep their windows rolled up. Lots of emotions go through my head when I see the desperate condition of most of these folks – sadness, powerlessness, frustration, anger that such conditions exist in our supposedly affluent neighborhoods.\nMontgomery County, as well as other jurisdictions, has asked that people not give money and food to the men and women begging in the intersections. Recently, a woman was run over and killed while she was soliciting for money. So, what can we do to help? Our county leaders recommend that we contribute to organizations that combat hunger. One of the most highly respected organizations in our area to do this is the Capital Area Food Bank.\nDuring this holiday season, Sandy Spring Bank is helping fight the battle against hunger by donating meals to the Capital Area Food Bank. Founded on January 15, 1980, the same day as Dr. Martin Luther King’s birthday, the Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) has been valiantly fighting hunger in the Washington metro area.\nWith 21,000 volunteers, and just 130 staff members, CAFB distributed 45 million pounds of food – equivalent to 37.5 million meals – to nearly 500,000 people last year. Partnering with 500 soup kitchens, food pantries, homeless shelters, youth and senior programs and other non-profit agencies, these dedicated people work to eradicate the pain of hunger and malnutrition. The CAFB not only distributes food, but also focuses on promoting nutritious, healthy food by expanding the donation of locally grown fresh produce.\nI had the honor of touring the Capital Area Food Bank facility on November 18, 2013. This modern facility, paid for by the contributions of individuals and businesses in the metropolitan region, is just 1½ years old. It is an impressive building with 21,000 square feet of demonstration area to teach cooking, grocery shopping, gardening and nutrition. The food storage capacity is double compared to their previous facility.\nOf the estimated 700,000 people in our geographic area who are food insecure, nearly 150,000 are children. It is a myth that hunger is not a problem in our affluent area.\nIt is a myth that most hungry people are homeless. It is a myth that people are hungry because they are too lazy to work. It is a myth that SNAP, also known as “food stamps,” is enough to feed a family.\nThe Capital Area Food Bank was established one year after the food stamp program had its first budget cut in 1979 because the need to fill the hunger gap was apparent. Today, one in six of our neighbors face hunger.\nPlease join us in the fight against hunger. Neighbors helping neighbors. We do make a difference together.\n\nSharon Hill is a Vice President and Branch Manager of Sandy Spring Bank.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

For these families, the struggle is real, and parents working two or more jobs just to feed their children is pretty much all they can focus on.That’s why this Stuff-A-Truck event means so much to me. Obviously, the effort itself, and the partnership with the Capital Area Food Bank is important, and does a lot to help people in need.But getting to meet so many wonderful people is the part that touches me most. Our viewers and supporters turn out by the thousands, all to help those who are less fortunate. Their enthusiasm and the stories they tell are truly touching. Everyone has a story of why they want to share, and how it makes them feel.Please join us on Friday, December 13 — we get to have fun!  It’s usually pretty cold, so you will see us dancing and moving around and having as much fun as we can.The goal is to collect non-perishable goods for all those in our region who risk going without this holiday season. My Fox5 colleague Holly Morris practically turns Stuff-A-Truck into a competitive event, so all of us at the other locations are always trying to keep up with or top what she’s doing!  At the annual Stuff-A-Truck there’s just always a great spirit, for a great cause.Find the participating Giant location closest to youso you can drop by on Friday. December 13.

Being able to meet the President of the United States makes them feel like they are really somebody.”\nAs hundreds of children and seniors visited the Capital Area Food Bank the day before Thanksgiving to receive special food for the holidays, they got a very special surprise.\nThe volunteers helping to distribute the Thanksgiving fare were President and Mrs. Obama, their daughters, Sasha and Malia, and Mrs. Robinson.\n“When I go home and tell my mother I met the president, she’s not going to believe it,” says Juelz, 10, whose school participates in the Capital Area Food Bank’s Kids Cafe program.\nBefore beginning his volunteering, part of his annual service project, Barack Obama greeted food bank staff with gratitude for their work year-long.\n“Thank you for the great work that you’re doing. And now you’re going to put me to work, right?”\nThe First Family handed out fresh produce, presidential candies and gift cards to each senior and child who stood in line.\nMrs. Obama’s mother, Marian Robinson, placedrecipe cardsinto the bags with the ingredients for sweet potato curry.\nStrong show of support\nA group of 14 veterans representing The Mission Continues, an organization composed of post-9/11 veterans who are awarded community service fellowships, worked alongside the president.\n“This is the third year in a row he has chosen the Capital Area Food Bank to volunteer his time just before Thanksgiving,” says Nancy E. Roman, President and CEO. “That’s the clearest, strongest show of support of our efforts to solve hunger I could hope for,” she said of his Wednesday visit.\nCAFB has more than 500 partner agencies in the region. They come to our huge distribution center to pick-up healthy food, which they then bring back to seniors, children and families in need. The same thing happened Wednesday, except that instead of selecting food from our wide shopping area, they were handed pre-prepared packages of food — by the President of the United States!\nBarbara Byrd, 72, shook the president’s hand, and thanked him for his support. He graciously smiled. Awestruck, she said that as a woman who receives food through the Brown Bag Program, she was happy to see him volunteering at the food bank. He thanked her for her kind words and then chided, “You’re not going to let go of my hand, are you?”\nPerhaps the president keeps coming back because he knows that more than 3,000 seniors are served by our Senior Brown Bag program, and that our Kids Cafe program serves an average of 2,800 children in 80 locations in the region and that our Weekend Bag program provides supplemental groceries for children to take home to their families.\nMr. Obama’s continued support goes beyond the hours he spends volunteering at our facility.\n“The President sent a powerful message on behalf of those struggling with hunger in difficult times,” Roman says. It reinforces the importance of solving hunger one child at a time, one senior at a time.”", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Meals that are easily made with food bank food items, and can serve a family of four for less than $8.\nNot comfort food, comfortable recipes\nKate Sherwood, the executive chef at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, shares recipes with volunteers from different food bank partners.\nWith an eagle eye, she hovers over the amateur cooks, each standing at his or her own cooking station donning an apron, making a dish they have never made before.\nSherwood, a volunteer herself, is looking for any little hitch in the recipes.\nIs there an ingredient people are not comfortable with? Are people raising their eyebrows when the recipe asks them to “puree” something? Sherwood fears that someone might skip her healthy recipe if there is something in it that is not in their comfort zone.\nShe has advice for each cook. How to better chop an onion. Why we should rinse canned vegetables if they are not salt-free. How to properly roast garlic.  Her goal is to have the volunteers learn from their kitchen experience while at the same time, giving her an insider’s view of how amateur cooks interact with new recipes.\nOnce the dozen or so dishes are complete, everyone sits down to share. But unlike other meals, the cooks now become critics, required to write down their impressions of the dishes.\nSherwood feverishly takes notes while they share their thoughts on whether the dishes were easy to make, tasty, and whether the cooks could picture themselves using the recipe at home.\nIf it gets the thumbs up on all three of those tests, the recipe becomes part of ourHealthy Recipe Database, currently chock full of tasty meals that are low in calories and sodium and high in protein.\nThose same recipes are also printed on cards in English and Spanish and be distributed with food at more than 500 agencies.\nOur commitment to healthy eating goes beyond offering fresh healthy food to our recipients.

Roman•November 25, 2013\nThis just in: What you eat affects your health. And it’s true no matter where you live or how much you earn.\nFor years, Wall Street brokers, Silicon Valley innovators, and celebrities have been paying nutritionists to advise them on antioxidants, balancing their protein consumption, free radicals and gut bacteria — all under the clear assumption that food matters to health and wellness.\nIt does.\nYet the obvious nature of this long-known fact has yet to fully pervade the conversation at the other end of the socio-economic spectrum, where too often the effort, the policies, and the systems are focused on providing quantities of food without paying attention to the critical link between food and health.\nThe systems that support food access for poor communities — including federal programs, grocery chains, and even food banks — often wind up delivering inexpensive, mass-produced carbohydrates.\nThis unfortunate phenomenon wasn’t meant to disadvantage those with the least economic means.\nRather, the fact that these are the products most available for distribution or donation is an unfortunate collision of capitalism and our taste buds, which tend to crave salt and fat, regardless of whether they belong to the rich or poor. It doesn’t help that the things that are best for us are also the most perishable.\nBut we now have the burden of knowledge. We understand that too much salt and fat can shorten life spans. Refined and added sugar contributes to type II diabetes, which is occurring at higher rates in poorer communities. We know that too much sodium contributes to high blood pressure and heart disease.\nAs we head into the season of giving, when so many are focused on generously providing food for others, it is critical to pay attention not just to having enough food, but to having enough of the right foods.\nAt the Capital Area Food Bank, serving the Washington metro area, we are distributing more fresh fruits and vegetables, and are working to provide canned and frozen vegetables with less salt and canned fruit packed in its own juice. We are also trying to lead other food banks in this direction.\nOurHealthy Recipe Database, designed to help our community eat hearty meals on a budget, is growing bigger and bigger every week.\nIf you participate in a food drive this time of year, such as our upcomingStuff A Truckevent on Friday, December 13, please try to give canned vegetables without added salt, fruits in their own juices, or canned proteins.\nIn fact, we have come up with a handy list ofMost Wanted Itemsbased on the needs of our community, and the healthy meals they are being encouraged to eat.\nAs society better appreciates the pivotal role food plays on our health, it becomes ever more important that our actions and policies are consistent with what we know.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Check out this video produced by Fairfax County Public Schools.\n\nThe Capital Area Food Bank sponsors the monthly Family Market by providing food.\nParents choose what they need and what they will use and bring it home to feed their families.\nFamily Markets provide fresh produce and pantry items once a month to 1,500 families with school-aged children.\nSmoothie Bike!\nFor the first time at a Family Market event, we offered students at Bren Mar the added bonus of trying out our popular Smoothie Bike.\nWith it, the 50-60 students in attendance learned how making healthy snacks is not only easy, but fun, too.\nKids got to measure out ingredients like pumpkin puree, ice cream and coconut and then hop on the Smoothie Bike and make a Pumpkin Smash Smoothie!\nThe goal is to have the Family Markets include more than just food — more and more often, they includes fun things that make it feel more like a market such as recipes, activities and other ways to spread the word about healthy eating.\nThe kids at Bren Mar followedthis easy recipe.\n“There was one little boy who was adorable,” says CAFB’s Michael Hollister, who was coordinating the event with me that day.\n“After pedalling so hard to make the healthy smoothie, he tasted it, and loved it!

However, on November 1 all families will see their benefits decrease due to the end of the extra benefits provided by ARRA.These changes affect all SNAP/food stamp recipients, but the actual change to benefits will vary from household to household.  For example, a family of two could see their monthly benefits decrease by as much as $20 and a family of four by as much as $36.In our region, many are seeing cuts in their benefits:\nCuts will affect those served by the Capital Area Food Bank, but the extent of the increase will not be known until after the cuts have taken place.  In the meantime, we are making every effort to meet the anticipated need throughout the Washington metro area.For more information on these changes as well as resources to help a family eat healthy on a budget, please visithttp://www.fns.usda.gov/snap-arra-2013.  Community members in need of food are also encouraged to call the Hunger Lifeline at (202) 644-9807 or log onto the CAFB websitewww.capitalareafoodbank.organd click on “Get Help” at the top of the home page.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

The average client’s monthly income is $750, or $9,000 a year, usually from social security.How do they manage on that meager income where the cost of living is one of the highest in the country?  One senior client who shared her budget with us describes the constant struggle to spend on necessities with scarce resources.Because she lives in subsidized housing, Allie pays $350 for rent and utilities, leaving just over half of her monthly income for everything else.   Since isolation in older adults causes depression and contributes to hypertension and a host of other illnesses, Allie refuses to give up her old car which provides her with some independence. Her budget and gas prices allow her to drive to church and visit her local grandchildren.  She budgets $80 a month for fuel, car maintenance and license fees.Prescription medications soak up $130 in monthly co-pay and her car comes in handy here in being able to drive to the best choice for supplies for her asthma and high blood pressure. Allie budgets for insurance and savings at $60 per month and her clothing budget of $35 a month is spent at thrift and consignment stores, places where she still manages to snag some stylish hats and gifts for her grandchildren.With $95 left in her monthly budget, you may well be asking when we will get to food.  Wait.  There’s more.   Allie tithes to her church $37.50 a month.  On a spiritual and civic level, this makes perfect sense to Allie.  Because she visits food pantries, she feels the need to give back. Allie has a cell phone loaded with minutes at a cost of about $20 a month, making it is much cheaper than a land line and giving her added mobility.A voracious reader, library patron and church volunteer with an old television and radio, Allie spends next to nothing for entertainment, so $37.50 is left for food and whatever expenses may come up.  This is why Allie is an enthusiastic participant in food bank and pantry programs and why she may soon apply for SNAP (food stamp) assistance, adding another increment to those resources already stretched beyond the limit.The details of Allie’s life constitute a composite of so many Capital Area Food Bank clients.  Every day we strive to serve more and more people in the areas of most need.  With your care and concern, we will continue to increase our service.  Like Allie, we strive to reach an economy of scale; economies that will result in happier and more bountiful lives for our neighbors who are at risk of hunger.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

You only have to experience it once. It’s a terrible feeling,” says DC resident Kenneth Jones.The retired DC Police officer grew up in a middle-class family, always with plenty to eat. But when he turned 18, the third of four boys knew that his father wanted him to move out of the house, head out into the world and take on all the responsibilities that entailed.The budding musician and his band were playing some decent gigs in the Washington metro area when he decided to move in with the vocalist and percussionist.But income from their shows wasn’t steady, and rent is always due, regardless of whether a blues band is having a good month or not. It wasn’t long before Jones found himself hungry.“Let’s just say I was ‘food-challenged’ when I was 18, 19 and 20,” he laughs. “Having a butter and jelly sandwich for breakfast, lunch and supper was not unusual at all.”Although Jones never had to use the services of a food bank, that helpless feeling of not having enough money for food shaped a very generous decision he would make once he retired.His bass playing was demoted to a pastime in 1981 when he joined the District Police force. Jones spent his first five years on the night beat, patrolling the Capital Area Food Bank’s neighborhood in Northeast Washington DC.Many nights on the beat had him thinking about his past. After working through the helicopter branch of the force and the forensic division, Jones retired and when he did, he still had hunger on his mind.With no children and no living relatives, Jones wants to help future generations in his community. He named the Capital Area Food Bank as one of the beneficiaries of his Federal Government Life Insurance.“When I think of all the work the Capital Area Food Bank does for the hungry, I am touched. It is a cause and an organization that is very near and dear to my heart,” Jones says.He says he knows that with a little help from others, hunger can be just a temporary situation.“One of my favorite sandwiches today is grape jelly and butter.

And that’s what he likes about it.“It’s a nice change of pace. I do policy and economic work all day long at the office, and when I come here, it is a completely different skill set,” he says.Lore, 44, hoists boxes and drops hundreds of donated cans into dozens of different bins in the Capital Area Food Bank’s huge food distribution center — hours of physical labor, with tangible results.“It is a workout to lift all those boxes! After an evening of [volunteer] work, when I look at an entire palette full of boxes, it is instant gratification,” he beams.The human resources consultant started volunteering at the Capital Area Food Bank in 1996, just after moving to Washington, D.C. from New Jersey to attend grad school. He was studying Public Policy at Georgetown University, and was immediately struck by the mission of the organization and the people the food bank reaches.“And I liked the idea of meeting other people. I have been volunteering for a minimum of one evening per month, and for all those years, the food bank has made me feel appreciated.”He knows the fruits of his labor will be appreciated, too, as he puts together bags brimming with a week’s worth of food for those unable to make ends meet every month.“It’s a nice feeling knowing the palettes we load will be at a senior center within two days,” the Glover Park resident explains.Every volunteer has a different reason for donating time to the hunger cause, and every socio-economic background is represented on the evenings when volunteers buzz around the sprawling warehouse floor.Currently, the food bank has attracted 18,000 volunteers a year, saving it $2.2 million in staff costs.“The food bank seems to keep its volunteers around for a long time – there is not a lot of turnaround. We never stand around wasting time – it’s very well organized.”“I like to practice selflessness.” Lore says, noting that he revels in spending time with those who share his passion. “Imagine, a Wednesday after a long day of work, when you are already tired, or early on a Saturday morning when they could be sleeping in – something is driving these people to come out to help their community.”Interested in volunteering with us?Click here.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Lambda Chi Alpha’s cause has been working to end hunger since 1993.We believe that our partnership with Feeding America will be an opportunity to give our men more of a chance to make a positive impact in the community. Through this experience our young men put the value of service and stewardship into action.Being a CEO of a non-profit, men’s social fraternity has its challenges. However, it also has many amazing opportunities. When I introduced this new partnership the crowd of young men was sparked with enthusiasm. They embraced the challenge of raising 1.5 million pounds of food and I feel that we will reach this goal. The fact is that our men on 200 college campuses across the United States already raise over one million pounds of food annually to help their communities. Since starting these food drives on the local level almost 20 years ago we have raised over 40 million pounds of food.The George Washington University chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha has a robust history of raising funds and donating food to benefit the Capital Area Food Bank. The group asked for food donations in dormitories and raised funds at our spring philanthropy event in Washington, DC called the Watermelon Bash, says Will Castagna, VP of External Affairs & Philanthropy for the fraternity.Last fall we donated 373 lbs. of food to the Capital Area Food Bank, and we will be looking to top our previous totals by going through more dorms and reaching out to more students this year, he says.”I am confident our Lambda Chi Alpha chapters in the DC metro area will be able to make a positive and lasting impact on the fight against hunger in the district,” Castagna says.We are honored to be a partner with Feeding America in this fight. Our men are committed to making a difference on their campuses, in their community and in this world. I ask that you also get your hands dirty. You never know how valuable your efforts to end hunger can be until you get up and fight with us for this cause.Bill Farkas joined the Lambda Chi Alpha professional staff as CEO in June of 2005.  He is a 1988 Butler University graduate and an Indianapolis native.

Roman told those attending the 2013 Northern Virginia Hunger Summit, held on Sept. 27 at the First Baptist Church of Alexandria.\nThe summit sponsored by the CAFB, brought together over 150 partner agencies, donors, supporters and community members to discuss food waste and, possible solutions. After thepresentations,  CAFB Director of Partners and Programs and Summit Moderator Marian Peele led a roundtable discussion, followed by a brief question and answer session.\nAttention was focused on the “Bill Emerson Act,” more commonly known as the Good Samaritan Act which protects donors from liability when donating food. Ben Simon, founder of theFood Recovery Network, told the audience that the act is not very well known and that publicizing the act to restaurants and grocery stores is crucial to increasing food donations. More information on the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act can be found on the Feeding America websitehereand the Environmental Protection Agencyhere.\n\nOne of the CAFB partners brought up the difficulty in receiving donations when the agency doesn’t have a refrigerated truck. Meghan Stasz of the Grocery Manufacturers Association acknowledged that refrigerated food trucks are an important part of maintaining food safety standards, however she spoke about some of the innovative ideas that Feeding America food pantries across the nation have used. One suggestion was for partners to approach companies that have refrigerated trucks and ask them to donate their time and trucks.\nAnother topic that was covered by Panelist Elise Golan from theSustainable Development Department from the USDAwas the importance of food dating by using labels such as sell-by, use-by and best-by to demonstrate food safety standards. She referred those in the audience to theUSDA Fact Sheet. This has been a continuing topic of conversation on theCAFBPartner Relations Facebook Page.\nFor further insight into topics covered at the Northern Virginia Hunger, those interested areencouraged to check out the CAFBblog carnivaland view some of the panel discussions onVideo.\nRoman expressed the hope that the summit would be a starting point for further community engagement around food waste.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

At theUniversity City District (UCD)in West Philadelphia we are building a whole community approach to prevent food waste by capturing surplus food and then diverting it to either feed needy people or for composting to enrich local soils.The UCD thinks it is on its way to becoming one of America’s first Food Secure Communities, where food is accessible to everyone every single day. The missing link needed to close the food gap between those with enough and those without is to dramatically increase food donations. The vision is to bring the entire neighborhood together to capture and distribute surplus food that would otherwise be wasted and to build economic benefits at the same time.Team effortWhat distinguishes this food recovery model approach is coordination through an economic development district and a focus on the entire community. If successful, everyone can celebrate and bring this issue to the forefront ofSustainable University City. This model can be replicated wherever the desire and resources are available.The UCD is a small 2.4 square mile mixed residential and commercial neighborhood with about 48,000 permanent and university residents. It houses three universities, medical buildings, federal offices, and numerous restaurants. Despite its small breadth, it disposes more than a million pounds of food every month. Most of this food goes to the landfill, some down garbage disposals; a little is transformed locally into soil compost, and a meager — although precious — amount is gracefully placed on the plates of food-insecure people.UCD launched the first pilot program of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)Urban Surplus Food Recovery Modelon June 5, 2013. What at first was an attempt to divert local food from landfills has grown into a working model for a hunger-free community. About 21% of the residents are food insecure. Our initial goal is to keep the community pantries, cupboards, and shelters full (Map the Meal Gap).UCD joined the pilot after an USEPA community-based analysis of food resources in Philadelphia found that they had all of the elements that our team thought would be needed for success, such as:• For-profit food recycling businesses• Social and environmental aura• Community composter for residential drop-off• Diverse sources of surplus food• Leadership – one of the strongest economic development districts in PhiladelphiaHelping hands are deliveringThe USDA provides most of the food support with over 6.3 million pounds going to the zip codes that include the UCD.Local food agencies distribute another 160,000 pounds of food collected from neighborhood donors. This is not enough though; the community is not hunger-free. Based on our preliminary estimates another 2.2 million pounds of food is needed each year or 6,000 pounds a day.Another 10,000 lbs. being tossedWe estimate that more than 250 local grocers, restaurants, hotels, colleges, and others are throwing out around 10,000 pounds of food every day that we can capture. That is more than we need and the reason for our optimism. We can gather what we need by matching local food collection and distribution agencies to local food sources. Surplus food that is not best for eating will be composted; hence, a new source of soil nutrients for the expanding number of community gardens in the District.Through its local food agencies, the District has just compiled a list of criteria for successful donations along with a list of experts at the local food banks that can arrange for safe, reliable food pick-up and distribution to patrons in the community.Here is a partial list of some of the other UCD activities that are helping:• Media event and press releases• Distribution of attractive Food Recycling Project informational postcards• Street Teams meeting with their neighbors• UCD Food Recycling Project window stickers for supporters• Tools and data support from USEPA• A new websiteSpecific goals setUCD intends to double the number of residents composting food within a year. SHARE, a major food relief organization, will increase the number of local direct pickups by 50% and the amount of donated food by 50,000 pounds in the first year.Other goals to integrate farms, colleges, churches and others to the pilot have also been set. Current trends indicate that we are on track to meet the goals.Momentum is building in the daily fight against food waste and hunger because people care.Thomas O’Donnell is an Adjunct Professor of Sustainability at Philadelphia University", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

And although this huge amount of waste suggests serious problems with the way our food is produced, transported, sold and consumed, it also means a lot can be done to save this food from the landfill.\nFood loss vs. food waste\nGenerally, food loss refers to food that spoils or rots close to the farm. For example, a stockpile of corn might be eaten by pests, or a tomato could be squashed on its way to market. Food waste, on the other hand, occurs when someone makes a decision to throw away food that could have been eaten, like when a grocery store throws away unsold vegetables or when a household throws out a loaf of moldy bread.\nFood loss tends to be a bigger problem in places like Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where infrastructure isn’t as developed, but in countries like the United States, the real problem is food waste. Almost 70% of all the calories lost and wasted in the US are thrown away at the retailer, restaurant or consumer level, which reveals a serious problem in the way we approach food.\nThere are numerous reasons this happens. Sometimes, as the Natural Resources Defense Council and Harvard University detail in a new report, it’s because of confusing date labels that lead people to throw away perfectly good food. Other times it’s because of portion sizes in restaurants being too large, or because an all-you-can-eat buffet encourages people to load up their plates with more food than can be eaten. A consumer might not be sure of the best way to store their fruit, leading to it spoiling faster than it would otherwise.\nInternational movement underway\nThese represent just a few of the problems that add up to an astonishing amount of waste.However, a real movement around reducing and recovering food loss and waste seems to be taking off. In the European Union, the European Parliamenthas calledfor food wastage to be cut in half.\nHere at WRI, we’re working with international partners on a global food loss and waste protocol that will give guidance on how businesses and governments can measure the food loss and waste that happens in their own jurisdictions. In the US, the US Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency have launched aFood Waste Challengeto change the way we think about food waste in this country. And now the Capital Area Food Bank is working to reduce waste right here in DC.\nThe problem of food loss and waste is big and complicated, but with global demand for food continuing to rise, now is the right time to take action – at all levels, from global to local, and at all steps, from farm to fork.\nBrian Lipinski is the lead author of Reducing Food Loss and Waste, a joint report from World Resources Institute and the United Nations Environment Programme.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

This cross-industry initiative brings together experts from nearly 30 leading companies to find innovative solutions to reducing the generation of food waste, increasing food donation, and recycling unavoidable food waste in the U.S.By sharing best practices, sponsoring new research into the sources and caused of food waste in America, and engaging with stakeholders around the country, the FWRA is tackling food waste not just as one company or one industry, but as a large section of the food value chain.Creative, cross-industry or cross-stakeholder efforts are the key to reducing food waste in the U.S.By talking to our partners up and down the value chain, companies, organizations, and other stakeholders, can make major strides to reducing food waste and feeding those in need.

By reducing this waste, we can help ease pressure on our precious natural resources and reduce production of methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas that is generated by food decomposing in landfills. We can also help put food on the table for families in need.The USDA estimates that 2008, the amount of uneaten food in homes and restaurants was valued at roughly $390 per U.S. consumer – more than an average month’s worth of food expenditures and almost three times the average monthly Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit. By reducing our food waste, each of us could put some of this money back in our pockets.By reducing their food waste, manufacturers, restaurants and food stores can improve their bottom line. By donating excess food, they can also help put food on the table for families in need. Across the county, businesses are doing just that.Feeding America, a leading domestic hunger-relief charity, estimates that food donations supplied 2.7 billion meals to its clientele in 2010. “Rock and Wrap It Up!”, an award-winning national hunger relief program, provides 100,000 meals every week from the leftovers from schools, hotels, sporting events, rock concerts, political gatherings, film shoots and television productions.As part of its contribution to theU.S. Food Waste Challenge, USDA is initiating a wide range of activities including activities to reduce waste in the school meals program, educate consumers about food waste and food storage, and develop new technologies to reduce food waste.USDA will also work with industry to increase donations from imported produce that does not meet standards, streamline procedures for donating wholesome “misbranded” meat and poultry products, update U.S. food loss estimates at the retail level, and pilot-test a meat-composting program to reduce the amount of meat being sent to landfills from food safety inspection labs.By working together, we can reduce food waste in the United States and put more food on the table for families in need.Elise Golan is Director for Sustainable Development at the Office of the Chief Economist, U.S. Department of Agriculture", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

In 2011 alone, more than 36 million tons of food waste was generated nationally.  The amount of food wasted stands in stark contrast to this country’s need to provide food assistance to the 50 million Americans who are food insecure.In order to solve hunger, we have to address waste.This year at the annualNorthern Virginia Hunger Summitthe Capital Area Food Bank will convene a panel of local food waste experts moderated by CAFB President and CEO Nancy Roman to discuss the ways that we as a community can curb food waste by redistributing usable food to those in need.

{"title": "An International Perspective – Hunger on a Global Scale", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2013/09/18/an-international-perspective-hunger-on-a-global-scale/", "date": "September 18, 2013", "content": "BySneha Raghavan•September 18, 2013\nGlobal hungeris an urgent problem. Despite the seeming abundance of food, factors such as climate change, rising energy prices, increased demand for meat, a burgeoning global middle class, and rapid population growth are making it difficult to provide safe, nutritious food in the years ahead – especially for the world’s poorest people.  According to theUN Food and Agricultural Organization(FAO) LINK, about one-in-nine people routinely go hungry and as many as one-in-three people currently suffer from micronutrient deficiency — they have enough calories but lack  specific (and important) vitamins or minerals.A forthcoming report from theCenter for Global Developmentwill suggest that the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) needs to shift into a higher gear to minimize expected food shortages and reduce these unacceptably high levels of hunger.  As the world’s leading global institution dedicated to raising agricultural productivity, the FAO can have a much larger impact on reducing global food insecurity if it maximizes its potential.The FAO is an agency of the United Nations with the express mission to reduce and defeat hunger. Since its inception in 1945, the FAO has served as a source of expertise, helping developing countries modernize agriculture, improve forestry and fisheries, ensure good nutrition and food security. The FAO acts as a forum where nations can meet to negotiate agreements and debate policy about food production and related issues.And while the FAO doesn’t deliver loaves of bread or cartons of milk, the FAO plays a critical – though wonkier – role in fighting global hunger: it provides data on global food production and consumption, offers early warning systems related to impending times of famine, generates information about disease and pests threatening crops, and reports on agricultural trends across the globe.While these services may seem less important than flying a plane full of food to famine-stricken countries, this information is critical to anticipate and meet the nutritional needs of the world’s growing population. Without it, global organizations and independent nations would not be able to meet and address hunger.According to the experts who authored the upcoming CGD report, food deprivation is already unacceptably high and slated to get much worse in the years ahead without leadership from FAO. The FAO cannot solve all of the food security problems going forward —but it is impossible to consume food that is not produced, so this should be the first order of business for the agency. The FAO’s global perspective and cross-border reach, the respect and trust it continues to enjoy in developing countries, and its network of agricultural and economics experts are the FAO’s strongest assets. The FAO should leverage these assets and lean in towards its strengths – by doing so, the organization can make a decisive impact on global hunger.While we all work to make an impact on hunger in our local communities, it’s also important to step back and occasionally consider a worldwide view. Everyday the world gets smaller and more interconnected – and everyday it becomes clearer that we are part of one global community, our futures intertwined and subject to the same forces.The Center for Global Development will release the new report on FAO and the ways it can better address food insecurity in October of this year. Until then, more information about food and agriculture can be found on theCGD website.

We are on the cusp of intervention in Syria.  Here in the nation’s capital, budget battles loom.   It often feels like there is no easy answer to the world’s big problems.Amid these challenges, it is daunting to ask folks to pay attention to yet another of the most stubborn challenges – continuing, debilitating hunger that plagues girls and boys, old and young, black, white, Latino and every other race in every single county.Yet, unlike so many problems, where we don’t know what to do, hunger is a solvable problem:  Providing nutritious food for a child is a game changer for that child.  It means his cognitive capacity can fully develop and that he can pay attention in school (education); it means her immune system can fully develop  and she can better fight disease (that’s health).  And ultimately, that education and improved health make it more likely that both he and she will be able to get and hold a job.So, solving hunger is more than an act of compassion. It is the building block of a strong society.That’s why we’ve asked a group of respected civic leaders, elected officials and business leaders to blog against hunger this month as part of an effort to raise awareness about hunger and compel people to help solve it.As you scroll through the blogs, please leave your comments behind those that intrigue or inspire.

This includes not only spiritual needs, but physical needs as well. The cost of living in the Woodbridge area is staggering. According to the2012 US Census Quick Facts for Prince William County, 5.6 percent of the population is surviving at or below the poverty line. These conditions literally cripple individuals working to provide adequate housing, clothing and food for their families.Despite these sobering statistics, I am grateful to say that we at Holiness Tabernacle have remained committed to demonstrating Christ’s agape love to our fellow man. Our partnership with the Capital Area Food Bank has enabled us to stretch the generous dollars of our local membership. Fifteen thousand people are fed yearly through our bi-monthly, local food pantry program. That’s more than 200,000 pounds of non-perishable food, meats and fresh produce distributed over the past three years. Many participants of our program visit each month, reminding us that these food items go a long way to help supplement limited budgets.We’ve also seen tremendous success with the growth of our annual Free Turkey Giveaway program.In 2011we distributed 400 turkeys and just thispast November, we distributed more than 700 turkeys in less than two hours. We also work with the Prince William County school system to identify and provide Thanksgiving baskets filled with stuffing, green beans, cranberry sauce, turkey – all the food items needed for a grand Thanksgiving meal – to families who wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford it. The demand for our Turkey Giveaway have grown so large, we’ve had to hire Sheriffs to direct traffic on the streets surrounding our building.But despite these successes, we understand that we can’t rest on our laurels. Currently, our 100-person membership funds these programs almost entirely. In order for us to sustain and grow these vital programs, it will require additional resources and partnerships with community organizations and government agencies. We can’t do this on our own.Although the food distribution program has been the main thrust of our mission program, we are coming to the realization that we need to expand our outreach program to the meet plethora of needs facing the community.  As the number of people we serve increases, the resources seem to decrease.And that is why I am joining with the Capital Area Food Bank to bring awareness to Hunger Action Month. It is critical that those of us working every day to meet the demands of our communities share our stories and convey the great need for additional support.This month, I encourage you to seek out ways to help someone in need. If you would like to partner with us in our effort to provide food to families living in Prince William County, contact us at Holiness Tabernacle at 703-497-7928.I bless you in the name of the Lord!Eddie B Pruitte, Jr.Holiness Tabernacle COGIC, Pastor & Founder", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

They asked individuals of all ages a series of questions in order to help us better understand how those living in the District perceived hunger – and who suffered from it.  The first and most important question on the list was, “What comes to mind when you think of the word ‘hunger’?”  All the folks we interviewed gave similar answers.  Here’s what most of them said:“Africa.”“Third world countries.”“Starving children overseas.”Not one mentioned hunger in America, much less in the District of Columbia.  Certainly no one uttered the word “seniors,” the cohort of the population that has been the focus of my work for over the past 20 years.  Other people might have been frustrated by the results of this experiment, but I had the opposite reaction.  It only reignited my zeal and my conviction that wemuststart the conversation about senior hunger, and all hunger, in communities across America.  Only then can we begin to address this real, serious and growing problem and prevent it from occurring in the first place.\nAt our organization, theNational Foundation to End Senior Hunger, we strongly believe you cannot solve a problem unless you know the causes, consequences and prevalence of the problem itself.  That’s why, in our work, we rely heavily on the original, independentsenior hunger researchwe commission year after year.  Our latest research study,The State of Senior Hunger in America 2011: An Annual Report, provides important findings that every one of us should know.\nThis recent report provides information on the percent of individuals age 60 and older in 2011 who faced the threat of hunger in each of the states and the District of Columbia).  The nation’s capital ranked 36th of the 51, with 51 being “best.”  The data reveal that 12.3 percent of seniors faced the threat of hunger in 2011 in comparison to 14.7 percent in 2010.  That is a 17.5% decrease in senior hunger in the District over a year’s time; that is the good news that confirms my belief that the problem is solvable and progress can be made.  The bad news is that nearly one in every eight seniors was still threatened by hunger in 2011.\nOverall findings show a substantial increase in the number of seniors facing the threat of hunger over the past decade (2001 -2011).  In 2011, 8.8 million seniors nationally faced the threat of hunger, representing an 88% increase in the number of seniors affected since 2001 and a 42% increase since the start of the Great Recession in 2007.  Put another way, 1 in 9 seniors faced the threat of hunger in 2001, while in 2011 nearly1 in 6 seniors were affected.  That is why I call these last ten years the “Decade of Shame.\nState of Senior Hungeralso identifies those seniors who are most vulnerable, including baby boomers (i.e. the “young old”), grandparents living with grandchildren, women, non-whites (Hispanic and African American seniors) and those who are poor or near poor.  In the District of Columbia, a city known for the diversity of its residents, all of these groups are present and many continue to struggle.\nIn honor of Hunger Action Month this September and the forgotten seniors facing hunger right here in the shadow of our nation’s capitol, as well as elsewhere across our country, I implore you – and anyone else in the District of Columbia who will listen – to stop this madness. Pledge with me to work tirelessly until we have eradicated this scourge.  Senior hunger in America is alive and well, not because it is inevitable but because we have failed to make this issue one of national and local urgency.  Let’s not settle for the 36th spot on this list, but instead fight for the day when there will be no list at all.  Our seniors should not have to suffer another ten years of hunger.  They should have the opportunity to live the rest of their lives with the dignity they deserve.  The time of waiting on the federal government or corporate America or any other single entity to find the solution is over.  We are all accountable and need to work together in this fight.  Senior hunger is a problem, but as I’ve said, it’s solvable.  And I will keep saying that until we’ve proved it so.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

This is a title I’ve come to take a great deal of pride in. Though I live in an affluent county that is admired nationwide, thousands of our residents face the daily struggle to put healthy, nutritious food on the table.Food insecurity is a nationwide challenge.  In our area, the Capital Area Food Bank reports that 40 percent of its clients must choose between food and other necessities like housing, utilities, medical care, and transportation.In Montgomery County, the economic downturn has forced more people than ever before to ask for public assistance.  In 2012, the county’s self-sufficiency standard, which is the minimum income for a family of four to achieve financial security, is approximately $82,877; and one-third of our students receive Free and Reduced Meals (FARMS).Following Poverty in America Awareness Month last January, I joined with hundreds of non-profit providers, residents, and elected leaders to “SNAP the Silence” about poverty and hunger by living on no more than $5 per day for our food budgets.  This amount is comparable to the assistance eligible residents receive under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).Formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, SNAP supports those whose wages are too low to lift them out of poverty, helping them put food on the table. In October 2012, approximately 65,200 county residents participated in the SNAP program. While the challenge was in no way similar to the struggles encountered by low-income working families, it provided new perspectives and a greater understanding of the issue for many who participated.As the challenge progressed, my mind quickly began to fixate on food.  I began to wonder, if I am this hungry, what do people who have physically demanding jobs feel like? How does a parent who works two jobs find the time to prepare and cook nutritious meals? How are these folks making it?As an outgrowth of this experience, I am excited to report that Montgomery County is taking action to help those who are living with food insecurity.  On September 10, I will join with the County Council’s Food Recovery Work Group, which I spearheaded, to announce an action plan to implement the first county-wide food recovery program in the nation.The Food Recovery Work Group includes representatives from the University of Maryland’s Food Recovery Network, Manna Food Center, Share Our Strength, Montgomery College, the Department of Health and Human Services, private sector partners, and faith-based institutions who serve the hungry.  This group was charged with evaluating the costs associated with creating a county-wide food recovery program and developing a strategic action plan for implementation.  The Food Recovery Work Group also evaluated best practices; identified existing resources and ways to enhance communication among non-profit organizations, service providers, and food suppliers; and recommended needed policy changes to assist in these efforts.  These recommendations will help us create a road map for establishing a streamlined process for collecting unused, edible food and distributing it to non-profit providers who serve the hungry.As a policy maker, I didn’t want a top down approach to deal with this issue.  The County Council needed to hear first-hand from our non-profit providers, faith-based institutions and community advocates who deal directly with helping those in need about where the gaps are and what they wanted to see.  My hope is that the Council, which unanimously voted to create this work group, will again join with me to implement these recommendations, so we can start a streamlined distribution system to get unused food directly to those who need it most.I was motivated to start a food recovery effort in Montgomery County, when I saw the amazing work that student volunteers were doing at the University of Maryland.  I was inspired by Ben Simon and Mia Zavalij, who have created a successful model of food redistribution called the Food Recovery Network at the College Park Campus.  As of May 2012, the organization donated more than 30,000 meals from the University of Maryland.  After helping to launch many other chapters at colleges across the United States, the organization is becoming a 501(c)(3) nonprofit with the mission of replicating the model in other communities.Hunger is an ever increasing problem in our community, and many working families struggle to put food on the table.  Since we have numerous public institutions and private sector partners who dispose of unwanted food, it seemed like a no brainer for the county to follow the lead of the students who began the food recovery movement.In 1966, Sargent Shriver, who was President Johnson’s Director of the War on Poverty said, “Most wars are declared by old men, but fought by the young.  But our war on poverty asks everyone to get into the fight.”We are fighting our own war on hunger and poverty right here in Montgomery County.  It is a daunting mission, but we are making progress.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

In the past three years, with the support of many of my colleagues on the DC Council, I have been able to pass legislation like the Healthy Schools Act of 2010, which requires schools to offer free breakfast to all students and the FEED DC Act, which establishes public/private partnerships to attract and renovate grocery stores in the District’s low-income communities. Additionally, we successfully earmarked $200,000 in the 2014 budget to support the “bonus bucks” program, which allows those receiving SNAP, WIC, and those participating in the Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program to increase their buying power at farmers’ markets, helping low-income families purchase more fresh fruits and vegetables.Although the District can be proud of these accomplishments, we cannot rest on our laurels. We must be vigilant in our work against the persistent ills of society, hunger among them. But the District cannot tackle this problem alone. We need federal programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps about 144,000 DC residents put food on the table for their families. Sadly, the 2009 Recovery Act’s temporary boost to the SNAP benefits is scheduled to end on November 1, 2013 and renewal appears unlikely unless hunger advocates here and across the nation put increased pressure on Congress to provide the additional $5 billion needed to sustain the program at its current levels.If the $5 billion cut is allowed to take effect, the District would see a $15 million reduction in SNAP benefits; a family of four would see a $36 monthly cut in benefits, leaving less than $1.40 per person per meal in 2014. This would be devastating for some of the District’s poorest communities located in food deserts with limited access to fresh produce and unprocessed foods. And limited resources plus limited access to healthy foods is the recipe for perpetuating obesity. No family should have to compromise the quality of their food to accommodate the quantity of food needed to sustain a household, yet these looming cuts to SNAP benefits may indeed make this an unfortunate reality for the nearly 144,000 DC residents receiving these essential benefits. This will also have severe economic implications; grocery stores and neighborhood farmers’ markets are sure to see a decline in revenue, which could mean layoffs, and that would further extend poverty among low-wage earners and continue a cycle of unhealthy eating.Although the District will begin preparing for the chance that these disastrous cuts will take place, it is up to those of us passionate about the issue of hunger, poverty, economic justice, and the health of our communities to put increased pressure on Congress to provide the $5 billion in funding needed to operate the SNAP program at its current levels. By establishing meaningful partnerships and alliances with economic, poverty, and social justice movements, we can build a coalition of advocates strong enough to get Congress to act on this important issue. Additionally, locally, we must devise contingency plans and innovative short and long term solutions that will ensure that we can still provide the assistance needed to help sustain DC families. As members of a community passionate about the scourge of hunger, I encourage you to reach out to me and to other members of the DC Council to share your ideas on how the District should adjust if the cut to the SNAP program does indeed take place. The District of Columbia needs the insight, knowledge, ideas, and passion of hunger advocates in order to solve both the short and long term challenges to ending hunger once and for all.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Manna is so much more than a food bank. As we enter our fourth decade, Manna’s staff, Board, and volunteers have a vision of our agency as a center of collaboration that synergizes the work of many different groups.  We believe in the power of community.Manna’s work with local farmers is a great example of community collaboration.  Each growing season we purchase and collect fresh produce from local farmers’ markets. We expand upon that with our farm share initiative withRed WigglerandOne Acrefarms allowing us to provide more than 215,000 pounds of healthy, fresh, locally grown produce for Manna clients.  Our new partnership withFarm to Freezerallows us to store produce to distribute in the winter months when these fruits and vegetables are not readily available.  I realize, though, that these types of collaborations may not be a new idea to many readers.  As a center, Manna both helps to foster and replicate innovations.For Manna, collaboration begins at home.  We have a stellar team of almost two dozen staff who come together each day to ensure that every person who comes to Manna in need leaves with food and filled with hope.  I am so proud to be joining such a center of service, and know I have much to learn from veterans like Blanche Hall, a distribution worker who joined Manna more than a decade ago, and Angela Whitmal, our Director of Administration, who is about to mark her 8th anniversary with the agency.  I’m also looking forward to building the team with fresh perspectives such as those of Lindsey Seegers, a recent addition to our nutrition education team.  Julio Huacache is another newcomer, and as I shadow Julio on his driving routes I am sure we will swap new insights into how best to reach Manna’s clients.Whether it is with the staff or among stakeholders in Manna’s service area,my approachto building a center of collaboration serves as a testament to the many teams I’ve been privileged to serve on over the years doing economic justice work.  Someguiding principlesI use:\nTo function truly as a center of service, education, and advocacy, Manna will need the team spirit of our fellow agencies and stakeholders.  I invite you to share your ideas and your approach.  My first full day on the job is September 9, 2013.  You can reach me atJackie@mannafood.orgor with a call to 240-268-2524.

Child hunger is a health problem, an education problem and a workforce problem.\nAlthough child hunger is entirely preventable and unnecessary, one in five kids in the U.S. lives in food insecure households.What is even more unacceptable is that child hunger is an even greater problem in our nation’s capital. According to Feeding America, Washington, D.C. has the second highest child food insecurity rate in the country, with 1 in 3 kids living in food insecure households.I’ve made a person commitment to the mission of the Capital Area Food Bank, which leads efforts to reduce hunger throughout Greater Washington.

I met Father Eugene Brake at a going-away dinner for Lynn Brantley, the co-founder of Capital Area Food Bank in Washington, D.C.  Father Brake is the other co-founder, and he began to tell me how it all began.  As he talked, I was amazed to learn his story. Father Brake has devoted his life to feeding the poor and helping the homeless. And he did it his way.He’s now 79, but decades ago he shunned church housing to live in dangerous inner city neighborhoods where he felt he could do the most good.  He walked or biked, never owned a car.  He never had a permanent residence, living from place to place.  He devoted himself to feeding the poor.  After all, Father Brake grew up in poverty in Wilmington, DE.  He was one of 14 brothers and sisters living in a three-bedroom house.  When his father retired, he was making only $6,800 a year, after having worked 49 years.  As Father Brake describes it, “I was poor, but I never felt poor.”Father Brake’s calling was on the streets of Washington.  He knew that perfectly good food was being thrown away because there wasn’t a way to store and distribute it.  In 1980, Father Brake helped organize an interfaith movement to establish the Capital Area Food Bank.  In Father Brake’s words, “People respond to feeding the hungry.”  In fiscal year 2013, the food bank provided 45 million pounds of food to children, seniors and families, including 17.5 million pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables. This is up from 33 million pounds in 2012, since the food bank moved into a brand new, beautiful warehouse.Father Brake’s eyes light up, and he smiles as he reflects on what he started.  “I can’t begin to know how many people I have helped in my lifetime.  When people are in crisis, lose a job or are about to get kicked out of their home, I get them some free food.  I want their money going toward keeping the lights on.”As dinner ended, I asked Father Brake where he was living now.  “I have so many homes,” he said.  “I’m not exactly sure where I am heading.  But, no worries.”  While he may appear to be carefree in his own life, his beliefs drive him to help others.  “All I ever wanted was the same opportunities for everybody.  That’s what drives me.  It’s the very nature of Christianity.”Margaret Mead is quoted as saying, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.”I’d like to thank Father Brake, Lynn Brantley and all the workers and volunteers of the Capital Area Food Bank.  It’s a shining example of a small group coming together and changing the world by helping other people.I’m Bill Marriott and thanks for helping me keep Marriott on the move.This blog was originally posted November 20, 2012 on the Marriott on the Move Blog with the title: In This Season of Giving, I Give Thanks to Father Brake", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

It’s about finding our clients the right partners and technical solutions – the whole package. Success is realized when people use technology to further the organization’s mission, vision, and business objectives.The same philosophy applies in service to our community, which is why DelCor has partnered with our clients and colleagues for 11 years in service to the Capital Area Food Bank. Together, we’ve collected more than 230,000 meals, driven hundreds of miles, served hundreds of hot meals (at CAFB partner agency Shepherd’s Table in Silver Spring), touched more than 100 organizations (and countless individuals), and filled more than 1,700 weekend grocery bags. Whew! The numbers really add up. But it all started with a simple question:why don’t we do something to alleviate hunger?\nBecause we are a small business serving association and nonprofit clients, we are naturally inclined to believe in community-driven missions and attract employees with the same community-oriented mindset. In fact, it was one of our staff who first suggested we do a food drive. And so we did!That was in 2003. We started with 15 organizations and collected about 2,500 meals, primarily through donations of nonperishable items. In 2013, with about twice as many organizations participating, we collected 63,000 meals in our first “all virtual” food drive using the AidMatrix online shopping system – touching hundreds of lives, both givers and receivers.\nAlthough it started small, the DelCor .org Community Food Drive is now our flagship charity event. The progress we’ve achieved with our partners and donors proves that you don’t need full-time staff (our marketing manager runs ours) or a charitable foundation to do something good for your community. You just need the will.Once you make the commitment, you can keep it simple enough that it doesn’t become overwhelming. For starters, why not put all those business connections to use for a great cause? You can do it, and here’s a 10-point playbook to get you going:\nDelCor’s food drive grew not only because we committed ourselves to the cause, but also because of how generous and engaged our community became. Every year, we expand our goal and encourage new ideas. You can do the same – but you have to start somewhere.Regardless of the type of drive you choose, sometimes just giving isn’t enough; many people want to do something. Instead of a scripted teambuilding exercise, volunteer to sort and pack groceries or staff an event at one of the food bank’s partner agencies. For example, we capped our most recent food drive with a volunteer night at the warehouse, where DelCor staff partnered with our association clients to pack weekend bags for children. Add volunteer hours to your benefits package. Solicit personal stories about the effects of hunger from your staff. Do good things, and spread the word.Together – and only together – we can solve hunger!", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}
{"title": "Universal School Breakfast Means Universally Nourished Children", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2013/09/04/universal-school-breakfast-means-universally-nourished-children/", "date": "September 4, 2013", "content": "ByChelsea MacCormack•September 4, 2013\nWhen the National School Breakfast Program (NSBP) was piloted in 1966, it was modeled after the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), an initiative created by Harry Truman in 1946 when he signed the National School Lunch Act. The NSLP grew out of several aid programs put in place during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when agricultural products were begging for a market and children were going hungry. The program was designed to redistribute farm surpluses to hungry children.While school lunch needs – and is currently undergoing – a nutritional overhaul, the NSLP has become a cornerstone of national childhood nutrition. Over 65 years later, more than 31 million children across the nation eat school lunch every day. The majority of those children qualify for free or reduced-priced (F/R) meals, which means they are living in or near poverty.iWith one-third of our nation’s children experiencing food insecurity, school lunch continues to feed children who are hungry.The National School Breakfast Program hasn’t been as successful. Of the nearly 20 million children who participate in the National School Lunch Program and who qualify for free and reduced meals, only 47% also participate in breakfast.At the same time, children who start their day hungry have a harder time learning, and therefore succeeding, in school. Studies have shown that students who eat breakfast are more likely to improve academic performance, as well as have fewer sick days and tardy days.Traditional school breakfast programs face significant challenges. Many school breakfasts are administered before classes begin, or “before the bell.” For many families, getting students to school before the scheduled start time is difficult because of family and work schedules and transportation issues.Additionally, many school breakfasts aren’t “universal,” (they aren’t served to all the children in the school, only those that qualify for F/R status) and so eating school breakfast can be a stigmatizing experience. Many children will choose to go hungry instead of being made fun of or being identified as “poor” because they eat school breakfast.So what is the solution? Universal “after the bell” school breakfast. My nonprofitFood Family Farming Foundation(F3) established Healthy Breakfast 4 Kids (HB4K) to help schools transform their breakfast program. In the first year of the program, we gave 117 schools in 29 states and the District of Columbia grants to build the infrastructure they needed to implement and sustain universal, after-the-bell breakfast. By serving all children a healthy breakfast in the classroom at the start of the school day, schools increased the number of children participating in the NSBP among the population that most needed healthy breakfast: children from disadvantaged households.Elaine Moore, School Nutrition Supervisor for Johnson County Schools in Tennessee, reported that her new breakfast program in Roan Creek Elementary School is a big success:“We have seen a very dramatic increase in the breakfast participation from last year to this year. Roan Creek has a very high free & reduced percentage. They have 487 students enrolled and about 400 of these students are eligible for free and reduced price meals.  Participation has increased from 214 per day to 435 per day.”When asked why the big jump in participation, Principal Dana Stafford replied,“In years prior, I think the students who qualified for free and reduced breakfast felt stigmatized and wouldn’t eat because the students they deemed more ‘popular’ arrived in the cafeteria in the mornings to wait for their homeroom teachers, not to have breakfast. Now, for example, when grades 4 – 6 report to the cafeteria in the mornings, they are there to wait for their teachers to pick them up.  No one is eating breakfast in the cafeteria when anyone else arrives.Even elementary-aged students don’t want to stand out as being different. They want to fit in. We have approximately 500 hundred students in Pre K – sixth grade and all are served breakfast together in their classrooms, equally. Students are no longer embarrassed to eat breakfast.”This one school encapsulates why universal after-the-bell breakfast is successful and should be implemented at all schools that have an F/R population over 40%. Every child starts their school day well-nourished, ready to learn and set-up to succeed in the classroom.To learn more about Healthy Breakfast 4 Kids and to read an evaluation of the initial year of the program, please visit ourHB4K pageiFor example, the federal poverty line for a family of four is $23,050. If the family’s annual income is less than $29,965 (130% of the poverty line), their children are eligible for free school lunch. If the family’s annual income is less than $42,643 (185% of the poverty line), their children are eligible for reduced-price school lunch.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

When taken apart, or decanstructed, the food is then donated to the Capital Area Food Bank.For many teams, tomorrow will be a true test of nerves. And for others it will be a welcome relief given the amount of work put into these projects thus far.  Judging by the design concepts that teams displayed on theirfundraising pages, project managers and builders alike have put in countless hours in preparation for tomorrow’s build.And why is there such meticulous project planning? Because these teams stand a chance to take home major bragging rights by winning one of the five awards handed outnext Tuesday night.

She always “made do” with very little. She was careful with money; she realized how circumstances beyond her control could quickly take her from sufficient to insufficient food.Success at home and workShe had a happy marriage to a hard-working man. After graduating high school in 1929, Paul Pfleeger knocked on doors to find any kind of work he could. He was an undertaker’s assistant, washed dishes and did various other jobs before landing a job as an assistant in a shoe manufacturing company. He rose through the ranks of production control at several companies, finally starting his own business.Emma was always generous with her time. Thanks to a strong work ethic and even stronger family values, she was comfortable for the rest of her years — never uncertain where her family’s next meal would come from.Fear of povertyAnd yet, near the end of her life, as she suffered from dementia, she had a distinct fear that she would run out of money, her son Chuck and daughter-in-law Shari recall. “That was tough to watch,” Shari says.At times, the fear of being poor again overcame her. Perhaps her dementia was taking her back in time, to disturbing memories of poverty in her youth and feelings of helplessness.Chuck and Shari knew Emma would want to do something to ensure that no family has to face just one potato for dinner, or not know where their next meal will come from.“We have long been supporters of the Capital Area Food Bank, and the work it does for the hungry,” say Chuck and Shari. They received a modest inheritance when the senior Pfleegers passed away, and decided to share some of that money with a community in need.The DC couple’s recent generous donation to the food bank honors Emma and Paul Pfleeger’s lives. Their struggle through the Great Depression, hard work and satisfaction of overcoming financial adversity are woven into the donation that will surely help others manage difficult times and see brighter days ahead.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

It was impressive for me to experience all the work that goes into running such an expansive organization and all of the bolts and screws that hold everything together. From stocking and sorting food in the distribution center to sitting in on strategic meetings and everything in between, I was blown away at how at every level, people worked so well with one another to achieve a common goal.There were many takeaways from my internship. I learned how important it is to work in a positive environment and surround oneself with optimistic thinkers. Every day, I was refreshed by the energy and drive demonstrated by the staff. Additionally, I was impressed by the receptiveness of the staff regarding our ideas. It was very exciting to see abstract ideas (my own, and those of others) come to fruition, especially theNeighborhood Captains project. Seeing all of our hard work displayed on fliers and the website was very rewarding.“Hard work pays off” is an expression that I have heard multiple times, but one that took on a new meaning after my internship. Performing tasks that at times seemed unsuccessful, such as making 75 calls to partner agencies requesting their distribution reports, often seemed ineffective. I learned, however, that the time and effort spent on jobs like these are what make the food bank run as smoothly as it does.Perhaps the most valuable thing that the CAFB did for me was to instill a sense of hope in the future. Hunger is such a large issue which at times can seem impossible to solve. After interning for five weeks, I can truthfully say that I believe hunger can be eradicated in the Washington metro area. Through direct outreach programs and going into neighborhoods, I was immediately able to see how receptive the public was to the food bank and how passionate people felt about helping their neighbors in need.It is said that together, people can achieve great things. I cannot think of a greater cause being solved by a greater family. I am truly thankful for my time at the food bank and all the lessons I will surely retain for life.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

I realized that there was a poverty issue in our country, but I never thought that families had to sacrifice going without food, especially healthy food. When hearing that one in six people and one in three children suffer from hunger in the Washington metro area, I immediately started to think about my friend’s birthday party at The Cheesecake Factory two years ago. We could only eat half of our meals and wasted perfectly good food because the people in my small community take our three meals a day for granted, when just miles away, people are going to sleep with their stomachs empty. Hunger is an issue that people don’t want to talk about, since in our great country, we want to stay in the dark about an issue that we know should be eradicated by now.\nBeing a young adult who aspires to be a woman of action, I loved witnessing all of the results that came from the hard work at the CAFB. It was an incredible experience to be in an environment where everyone thoroughly enjoyed their work and the impact they made. Working at the food bank taught me that working together is necessary for anything to be accomplished. Volunteering in the food distribution center opened my eyes to how much work goes into providing meals for residents in D.C., Suburban Maryland and Northern Virginia. Working on the farm was humbling and made me appreciate the hard and diligent work that goes into ensuring all residents have access to fruits and vegetables. The Capital Area Food Bank is truly taking the hunger crisis by the reigns and doing everything it can to help those in need.\nMy experience this summer at the food bank will positively impact my senior year in high school and future in college, and has helped me realize that although I am seventeen-years-old, I have the capacity to help make a difference. The sheer fact that last year the food bank distributed 45 million pounds of food, of which 17.5 million was fresh produce, amazes me and I feel so fortunate to have been a part of an organization that does so much good.\nBeing a senior brings a contradiction of emotions and experiences – you’re sad to leave high school, but you’re excited to go to college. You’re anxious about the future ahead, but can’t wait to be older. You hear about how fun the year will be, yet you’re swamped with college applications and AP classes. Above all, senior year is the time to explore your options in life. Entering my last year of high school with this internship under my belt has taught me invaluable lessons that I could only learn in an environment like the Capital Area Food Bank, and it has been an unforgettable five weeks for which I am very grateful.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

It is a hot and sweaty summer day in DC and you are staying as close to your fan as possible and I am staying cool inside my office at the Capital Area Food Bank. As I am finishing some paperwork and getting ready to head to a meeting, my phone rings. It turns out that there is an issue with the food at one of the sites. There are five seniors who didn’t receive bags and they really need this food as the end of the month nears.These seniors live by themselves and receive bags through a program called the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, a program that provides them with groceries to help make ends meet on a monthly basis. I hear about the five specific seniors who are really worried about their next meal.The food bank is the largest non-profit food distribution center in the Washington metro area. This means that through our hundreds of partners, we distributed 45 million pounds of food (37.5 million meals) last year. That amazing number happens through the dedicated teams working at the food bank and includes the truck drivers who provide food assistance to our neighbors by delivering truckloads of food to sites across the region we serve – Washington, DC; Northern Virginia and Montgomery and Prince George’s counties in Maryland. However, with all the food we distribute, sometimes we miss a beat, or sometimes we miscount the number of bags. This means that we have to figure out how to make a special delivery on this hot July day.That’s where Ford enters the picture. Today, I don’t have to worry about whether or not the boxes will fit in my car, because I am able to get to the site easily and quickly with ample space in a Ford Explorer 2013 Sport. This car was generously loaned to us by Ford for a week to help accomplish our mission. The car has a spacious trunk and is easy to drive. I hop in the Explorer and use the built-in GPS device to get me to my destination. I finally arrive and am greeted at the door by the site leader. The bags are easily unloaded out of the trunk and she thanks me for coming out. Every bag matters and especially during these hot months. Thank you, Ford.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

It’s not always visible; people can get up, get dressed and still be hungry.”During Obama’s Call to Service in January of this year, Lawson helped pack and sort food at the CAFB’s Northeast food distribution center.  And that’s how he got involved with the food bank.He has since created healthy recipes for food bank partners and clients, held food demonstrations in the agency lounge and even taught a group of teenagers how to make healthy alternatives to their favorite meals during a six-weekCooking Matters course– a feat he admitted was quite an experience.“Dealing with teenage girls was a bit chaotic.  They were hesitant at first to use whole wheat dough for our pizza dish and even more reluctant to bake chicken but in the end they loved it,” said Lawson.  He also taught the teens how to prepare ranch dressing, omelets and quesadillas.As a trained chef, Lawson understands that if food doesn’t taste good, then people don’t want to eat it.  He explained that cooking with herbs and spices is more flavorful and healthier than cooking with salt and fat.  He also understands that nutritious food is expensive.  During his Cooking Matters courses, he showed participants how to get the most out of food and their food budgets.Lawson continues to contribute his talents, because he’s impressed with the food bank’s multifaceted approach to hunger and its combination of food distribution with nutrition education.  The food bank relies on the support of community partners to further its mission of nourishing those in need and educating those it serves.

Roman•July 26, 2013\n\nMore than thirty years have passed since a fledging hunger movement gave birth to the Capital Area Food Bank.  In that time,  CAFB has provided tens of millions of  meals to children,  seniors and families throughout the region.But, hunger is still with us and the primary difference is that we have an even deeper and more nuanced understanding of how critical food is to education, to health and employment – the three building blocks of a strong society.We now have the burden of knowledge.We know that the lack of nutrition in a person’s early years can affect brain development and cognitive capacity.We know that a lack of healthy food can impair development of a child’s immune system for life.That’s why the fact that there are 681,000  hungry people, including 200,000 children, in our region is unacceptable. (Our calculation of hunger is based on 185 percent times the federal poverty level, because we believe, as do many nonprofits, that the poverty level is artificially low.)If we let those numbers stand, we will be undermining what we value most in society – education, health and employment.That’s why at CAFB, we are attempting to ignite a new movement against hunger by identifying and encouraging neighborhood volunteers to join us.  Although we have a hard working staff that gathers, gleans and procures more than 40 million pounds of food that produces 33 million meals across the region, we can’t do it alone.We need volunteers who will become neighborhood captains.

We want to make sure that The Capital Area Food Bank supports nutritious food and healthy eating. That will mean teaching about how to shop smarter on fewer dollars.\nIt will mean establishing a food growing capacity program, or an urban or suburban garden to produce enough vegetables to feed a family during the growing season. It will mean collaborating with those who are working on health job training and other issues that that contribute to hunger. It will mean working with area businesses to help us address the challenges we face in helping the hungry.\nWe want to drive a conversation about how to shorten the lines of those waiting for the next meal, even as we work hard to meet the hunger needs of those in line.\nI feel privileged to have a chance to head an organization that is leading the hunger relief movement in our region – the Capital Area Food Bank.\nTogether, we can solve hunger.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

But faith can lift her out of that misery, too.“It happened in 1991. I don’t mind talking about it. I am proud of my suffering,” says Karlene Webster.She and her husband were home builders in Northern Virginia – they owned their own company, and for many years, life was bountiful: good health, steady employment, and three happy children.But during the recession of the early 1990s, people stopped spending money on new homes. And just like that, builders started to go under.“Our lawyer told us that on average, he saw one person declaring bankruptcy every week, but that during the recession, he was seeing five per day,” Webster recalls.It didn’t take long before the family of five tapped their savings dry.“We had no choice. Neither of us was employed. Next thing you know, we were standing in a food line, and getting bags of groceries handed to us from out of the back of a car. People were without money, and without a job.”The children were 12, 10 and 8. They took it in stride. “We are Irish, so we tried to use humor, and laugh at the fact that all of our meals looked pretty much the same” but there was no hiding the stress, the sadness and the shame.Is it wrong to be getting help?“My husband was devastated that he was filing for bankruptcy, because he was always taught to pay his bills. I went to my priest, and I asked him ‘Is it wrong to file bankruptcy?’ He told me there was no shame in it, but we felt shame,” says Webster, 63.Their pride was hurt, but the couple knew the financial sting would burn for years, too, after filing for bankruptcy. With five mouths to feed, they had no choice.“We filed for bankruptcy on our wedding anniversary, Aug. 18, 1991.”What happened then was a miracle, Webster says.“In October, we finally found a buyer for our cottage – we had been trying to sell it for months – and we were thrilled. But that wasn’t the miracle.”When the couple got the check after the sale, they went straight to their lawyer who had worked on their bankruptcy a few months’ previous. “I said, ‘We have money. We want to pay off a bunch of our bills now.’”“Our lawyer told us, ‘I was cleaning my office, and I found some papers under my leather desk mat, Karlene. They were your bankruptcy papers. I never filed them.’” Webster was baffled as to how that could have happened, but more importantly, she was moved by this blessing.Their credit was still intact, and their recent windfall from the sale of the cottage put them back on their feet.Giving back to those in need“I was very aware that God had shown me how to take, and now it was time to give back,” she remembers.Webster said, “My first job after the recession was in international development work which tapped in on my raising — always seeing everybody as equal.”   Then from there Webster went to a local nonprofit, Lorton Community Action Center.  Now, more than ever, with her experience standing in food lines, she knew she could share her personal story with those in need.I knew how humiliating it was to ask for help, and so we helped struggling families with food and clothing in any way we could.”The mother of three has been working in the field ever since, and can easily relate to those standing in line for food, often in disbelief at their fate.Webster’s hope and inspiration were earned.  And her vow to give back to people just like her has been achieved.“I often tell my story to those who are in a similar situation – that’s who God sends to me! I tell them, ‘I DO understand. I’ve been in food lines with my kids.”", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Were it not for a longshot successful attempt at repairing a 48-year-old water valve, this week over 100,000 residents in southern Prince George’s County, Maryland would have been faced with the dire reality of being without water for up to five days.Preparing for such an emergency necessitates time, money and transportation. After the announcement of the intended shut down, many nearby stores sold out of bottled water, leaving little options for residents lacking adequate transportation, or for those who are home bound.  People who could find water were faced with a large, unplanned expense. Purchasing bottled water for drinking is, in and of itself, expensive. Purchasing bottled water for five days’ worth of hygiene, cooking  and drinking is a significant expense for most of the country, let alone for the 15% of Prince George’s County residents who are considered food insecure.By every right, this emergency could have become a crisis. Thankfully, we were spared this experience, but with an aging public works infrastructure it is not hard to imagine facing similar circumstances in the future.Situations like these remind us of the importance of water to health and of the critical role the Capital Area Food Bank plays in tapping its extensive logistics network during emergencies and natural disasters. After the public was notified of the water outage, the Capital Area Food Bank with help from Harris Teeter responded by providing significant donations to those in need.  Although the disaster was averted, the Capital Area Food Bank still delivered 21 pallets of water and ice to 7 different cooling stations in DC and Maryland to hydrate our communities in need amidst last week’s heat wave.Whether it is a disaster or just the day-to-day summer hear, the food bank, its partner agencies and its donors are here to make a difference for those who need it most.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

It’s New Mexico.)According to Feeding America’sMap the Meal Gapstudy, at least 31,000 children live in families who are food insecure, which means their families lack the resources to provide their kids basic food that provides enough nutrition and kilocalories.This is outrageous, unimaginable, intolerable.

A meal of chicken nuggets, small fries and a Coke from the dollar menu packs another 800 calories.These children have gotten all the calories they need – in fact more than enough.  But, they aren’t getting vitamins A, B, and C; riboflavin, fiber and other minerals needed to nourish the body.  Not surprising that these kids’ brains keep screaming “feed me” even as their bodies store excess calories as fat.

Hunger and food insecurity are damaging in terms of children’s life chances.Of course, missing key nutrients and calories can have a devastating effect on growth and development, but the psychological stress of food insecurity — not being able to afford a consistent and high-quality source of food — can be harmful to youngsters as well.\n\nYou can helpOur Skip Lunch Feed a Bunch campaign this summer is a fun way to make a huge difference in a small way.

{"title": "Listening Is Key to Hunger Solution", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2013/04/23/listening-is-key-to-hunger-solution/", "date": "April 23, 2013", "content": "ByDavid Poms•April 23, 2013\nSolving hunger issues cannot be done from the top down, says David Lee, Program Development Specialist at Feeding America. We have to listen to those in need, he urges.“We built this amazing structure for hunger relief largely without asking people who are hungry! We won’t be successful over the long haul without the voice of those people. We need to engage our clients, not just by giving them a box of food, but by empowering them, too,” says Lee, who is speaking at theApril 26 Metropolitan Area Hunger Conference. “So the question is: how do we use these services we are offering people to empower them?”The conference brings together those invested — either professionally or socially — in eradicating hunger.Nancy E. Roman, the Capital Area Food Bank’s new President and CEO, will open the conference with welcoming remarks,  “We understand that solving hunger is intimately related to so many important social developments.  If you are hungry, you cannot learn.  If you are hungry, your immune system does not develop fully.  If you are hungry, you have trouble holding down a job.”The keynote speaker, Enid Borden, is the Founder, President and CEO of the National Foundation to End Senior Hunger, formerly known as the Meals On Wheels Research Foundation.Lee continues, “We have to remind people who have day-to-day interactions with the hungry that they have immense power. The person-to-person relationship is valuable, because it reminds those in need that society has not forgotten about them,” Lee stresses, noting that we have a special responsibility to children.“At the conference, my goal is to remind people that child hunger is important. A child who is not eating is not learning, and is not healthy. Chronic health issues and underachievement in tomorrow’s generation are things we should all be concerned with. I will be sharing national opinions on that topic. There is a real disinvestment in our future going on here,” he notes, adding his aim is to present data in a clear and articulate way.Another of the conference speakers, Darlene Jenkins, says she is eager to meet conference attendees who provide services, “because often, in a researcher role, I don’t hear enough from the trenches. I want to learn from others.”Jenkins works with the homeless, and says those without shelter are inextricably linked to hunger. She adds her voice to the chorus saying we should do more listening.“People who survive the street are very resilient. Instead of looking at their needs, let’s build on their assets – what is their story? Let’s bring them along as we try to eliminate both homelessness and hunger,” says the Director of Research for National Health Care for the Homeless Council.Speakers at the conference, sponsored by the Capital Area Food Bank, are determined to take the conversation beyond where it is now.Pierre Vigilance, Visiting Professor for Public Health Practice at George Washington University, says we still have a long way to go in solving food insecurity.“People still don’t ‘get’ this issue — food security,” he says with resolve and not frustration. “People don’t understand that ‘limited access’ can mean either they have limited resources in being able to purchase healthy foods or limited access because of location – no nearby stores offer a decent variety of healthy food options,” Vigilance says.Junk food is less expensive, and that’s what allows bad eating habits to form, Vigilance says from experience. At 5’9″, he used to weigh 250 lbs. before dropping down to his current 170 lbs.“I used to have a problem with sodas. Back then, I didn’t know something a lot of people still don’t know: when food should be used as fuel, and when it should be used as fun. In general, we have too much fun with food. I know that sounds grouchy, but it’s true. We must respect food — get what we need and not more.”Others at the hunger conference speak for those who might not be eating a lot of junk food, but desperately need healthy food. “There are 100,000 seniors in the DC area. Some are socially isolated, many are on a fixed income and use expensive medication, all while the cost of living is increasing,” says John Thompson, Executive Director of the District of Columbia Office on Aging.“There are many misconceptions about seniors, the most common is that if they live in a nice home, they are not cash poor. But I know many who don’t have any liquid assets and need assistance, otherwise they will go hungry,” he shares.Discussion among advocates, providers and academics at the conference aim to help bring necessary improvements to the system.“The goal is to increase public awareness,” Thompson says. But also, to streamline resources by bringing together church, community and government services and matching resources to the needs of the senior community.”Aaliyah Smith-Parker, program associate at DC Hunger Solutions, will be also be a featured speaker at the conference. She will be discussing public health issues of working poor families.With backgrounds in research, policy and public service, speakers and attendees are working towards a common goal: trying to shrink the number of hungry in the DC metro area.“I am continually trying to work myself out of a job,” Jenkins says.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

We are data driven, we take what we learn from what we hear, and we say, ‘How do we make a societal shift to turn those numbers around?’”“I’ve been doing this for nearly a quarter of a century, and although we do talk a lot about hunger, the missing component is seniors,” she insists.Her organization’s annual report to the nation will be released in May. TitledThe State of Senior Hunger in America, it asks: How many seniors face hunger? Where do they live? What kind of services are they receiving?“The numbers are getting worse, not better” is her grim preview.

Waddle•April 12, 2013\nIt was Spring Break in Prince George’s County when I visited a community center  the Capital Area Food Bank works with — and ever since, I have been grappling with what I discovered there.The small center attached to an apartment complex is where children spent most of their school break. Rosmery, the site director who plans and implements activities for seniors and children, told me children were arriving at her center during spring break hungry.Her site didn’t open until 11am during the break and children were showing up without having eaten breakfast. Yet the Capital Area Food Bank was only scheduled to provide her site with one afternoon snack and meal per child per day.You see, a lot of low-income families rely on schools to provide free breakfast and lunch. When school is out, this resource isn’t available. The center’s situation is an indicator of the high need of the area.This reality struck me hard.They say there are seven stages of grief. Upon hearing about how hungry these kids were during spring break, I felt four of those stages:\nThe Capital Area Food Bank’s Kids Cafe is an after school resource providing snacks and warm meals to low-income children; but it doesn’t have to be confined to that – especially when we plan for breaks.By far, summer break is the longest. For almost three months, school breakfast and lunch is not an option for the families and their children. By the measure of Rosmery’s and my planning, that would mean Sunny Side kids would only be assured one meal and a snack a day. That’s unacceptable.Thankfully there are resources for these times of need.During the summer, the Capital Area Food Bank uses the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) to help cover the costs of free meals for children & teens. Last summer, afternoon snacks and meals were provided by CAFB sponsorship, and breakfast and lunch were sponsored by the Department of Social Services.This way, children who spend their days at the centers were assured three full meals a day – almost as if school weren’t out.However, there is still work to do.Some kids still go hungry during the summer. A staggering number of children who depend on school breakfast/lunch programs during the school year are not benefiting from the SFSP.Two reasons: not enough centers provide the program and not enough families are aware of the program.We can change all that. If your center is interested in using the program,contact me. Or,become a site just for the summer.If you know children who could benefit from the SFSP program,get in touch with us.Don’t make the same mistake I did.

I recall listening to Leah Chase, owner of the legendary Dookey Chase restaurant in New Orleans, at a Share Our Strength conference about seven years ago. One year post hurricane Katrina, she talked about hunger and offered wise words, “When legislators, service providers, and communities all sit down together and eat around one table, we will find the solutions we need.”During this brief but powerful visit to New Orleans, when streets were boarded up and the farmer’s market was just reopening for the first time,  there was a unity and a pulse around food that was palpable in the streets. I began to understand the vision of Leah Chase during that visit.Today, I reflect on how hunger in the United States is a quiet catastrophe that requires collective solutions. From Congress to corporations to one’s own kitchen cabinet, there are support networks to weave and strengthen so hunger doesn’t continue to happen in our own backyard.So this is my sketch on hunger “zoomed in.” Just a snapshot of food, connectivity, the kitchen cabinet and the table – where everyone sits together, eats together and finds solutions together.This post was first published onthe red lentil.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

The long lines for help with basic food needs are truly an assembly of the most diverse group of people you can find.Many are working full time and still cannot pay their monthly bills. Some are unemployed. Most have children. Many are seniors or people living with disabilities. I have also met a few who have spouses serving in the US military.About half of the people I talk with already receive the monthly SNAP benefit, but it is so small that it doesn’t come close to being enough for one week’s worth of groceries. I couldn’t live on $16 a month for food!People travel by bus, or metro; walk long distances; take cabs in groups, or get rides from neighbors to travel to the long lines at mobile food pantries. They are humble and thankful for the help, and a few even turn down the SNAP application saying that they believe things will get better for them soon. I certainly hope so.If we as a country could wrap our heads around the fact that we cannot survive alone, maybe we could begin to end this heartbreak that comes from poverty.

Passover provides an opportunity to understand and advocate for those who are not free from oppression.Sure, the institution of slavery is no longer present in our country, but our society is still struggling, and many are still hungry.Because of the theme of liberation, people sometimes hold traditional Passover meals or Seders, as they are called, focusing on civil rights, or issues such as paid sick days, all examining how we are not truly free.Throughout the week of Passover, we steer clear of leavened products, reminding us of the oppression the Jews felt while in slavery and the Jews fleeing Egypt. Matzah is considered the bread of affliction because the flat bread was not given time to rise — the Israelites had to flee without “being ready to go.”In current times, it reminds us that there almost 700,000 individuals at risk of hunger in the Washington metro area. Captive to debilitating budgets, they scrutinize everything they eat and buy, risking not being able to pay their rent and electric bills. The working poor face these choices. We cannot forget these people are still oppressed.The issue of hunger is urgent and we must act now. Every day, the number of children at risk of hunger who are unsure of where their next meal will be coming from increases.The story of Passover is a reminder that it is our responsibility to advocate for those who are oppressed and to write their story of liberation.Every Seder, we ponder the quote “We are not free until no one is oppressed.” This is parallel to the mission of the Capital Area Food Bank: “‘Til no one is hungry.”To end oppression and hunger, we must work together in our community.

The families served by the Capital Area Food Bank face similar challenges daily.Chef Spike Mendelsohn, former Top Chef contestant andBlue Jeans Ball Special Guest, is the first competitor in the food bank’s $10 Challenge. The challenge is simple:  create a delicious meal for $10 or less with healthy, affordable ingredients available at the food bank.We were wowed byChef Spike’s POW Peanut Chicken (PDF)recipe which, at less than $2 per serving, meets the key principles of aHealthy Affordable Meal.\nThis dish includes three food groups, which makes it well-balanced. The brown rice provides a filling whole grain, the corn and tomato offers a good serving of nutritious vegetables and the canned chicken and peanut sauce provide a protein punch.\nNo rice on hand? Switch the grain in this dish out for others that may be sitting in the cupboard. Try this with noodles!\nRepurpose ingredients in this recipe for other meals. Corn is great for soups, salads and casseroles. Canned tomatoes make great sauce, salsa, or soup. Brown rice is a great addition to soup, meatballs, or stir fry. When corn is two for $1, stock up to use in this recipe, and apply surplus for another meal during the week.\nThe peanut sauce and chicken give the recipe some protein punch. If chicken breasts are on sale, cooked and chopped chicken is a great way to add more protein.\nChef Spike brought out great flavors in this dish. The peanut sauce is creamy and incorporates well into all ingredients. The use of chili powder, water from the canned corn and a vinegar/sugar combo in the sauce creates a flavor explosion we’re calling the “POW” factor.National Nutrition Monthis drawing to a close, but the food bank continues transforming its ingredients into meals so that our partners can meet the challenge of hunger head-on.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Target has sponsored Orr and three additional school pantries in DC for two years.Surprisingly, it wasn’t so much their distribution that stirred my attention, but it was the character of one of the volunteers that opened my eyes to another aspect of serving the underprivileged.His name is Bernard, and he has been volunteering at Orr for over a year. He’s the guardian of more than one student enrolled at Orr, and he himself benefits from the School Food Pantry program. He feels that because he is receiving generous help, he too should be giving back.He orchestrates the drop-off while also assisting in preparing 10 lb.-20 lb. bags of food. Once families arrive, the bags are waiting for them. I have spoken with the families counting on this food, and they love what has been prepared for them.Bernard uses the food he receives to feed his family – a family that extends into the community, to his church and beyond. He wants to make sure that anyone in need can partake in his fresh produce that may otherwise be neglected and shunned.His “no food left behind” credo allows Orr Elementary to stand out among other food resource centers.In fact, all the volunteers at Orr Elementary give you a friendly smile to take home with you, and back where I’m from we call that a little “southern hospitality.”Here’s to Bernard and the other volunteer staff for running an exceptional food pantry.

From our garden to yours, here are three tips to ensure your garden “springs forward.”Start with the soil. First time gardener? Seasoned veteran? Success means starting with the basics. Healthy soil, easy drainage and access to water increase your ability to create a thriving garden. When growing in any space,test for soil qualityand if you aregrowing in containers, replace your soil every season so plants have access to essential nutrients.Make your bed(s). After lying dormant for the winter season, garden beds require spring cleaning. To prepare your beds, turn under any growth from the previous season.\nAdding organic matter to enrich the soil is the last step in creating garden beds that will thrive all season. The best source for organic matter isCOMPOST!  Compost adds nutrient-rich humus to fuel plant growth and restore vitality to depleted soil.Plan for Plants. Choose what you want to grow. Some plants should be planted from seed and others from transplants. This season, the food bank is partnering withFriends and Food International, Inc.and the students of the McKinley Tech High School’s Green Team to grow transplants for the Urban Demonstration Garden in their school greenhouse.Either grow your ownseedlingsor purchase them. Before you invest in seeds or plants, think carefully about what will be best for you to grow. Narrow down your list to the produce that you love to eat, is expensive in the store, and that you have space to grow. Use thisplanting guide (PDF)when planting your personalized list.Keep checking the food bank blog for updates on the building of the Capital Area Food Bank’sUrban Demonstration Gardenand learn how toget involved.Abbie Steiner is the Capital Area Food Bank’s Resident Food Growing Expert.

Waddle•March 18, 2013\nWhen I think of summer, I think of food – watermelon, corn on the cob and hamburgers sizzling on the grill.Unfortunately, not everyone gets to enjoy these pleasures.  Some people can’t cook these seasonal delights because they’re too busy making sure they have food in the first place. And often times these are families with children.School meals are a vital resource to our children, especially those at risk of hunger.  In 2011, 21 million children in our country received free or reduced-price breakfast and/or lunch at school.  Many families depend on this resource as it helps offset the costs of raising children.But what happens when school is out for the summer? Do 21 million children no longer need to eat?Of course they need to eat, but it’s much harder to reach them.The USDA provides the Summer Food Service Program through a network of local state sponsors, however, only 2.27 million children participated in the program in 2011 – that’s only 10 percent of the number of children fed during the school months.This doesn’t make sense to me. Are children no longer hungry over the summer? Do their parents no longer need assistance?I doubt it.It’s tough for SFSP to reach kids during the summer as they like to play, hang, run, laugh and not have to follow a schedule.  So the Capital Area Food Bank is working to ensure that more children participate in the summer food program.In the summer of 2012, theCapital Area Food Bankbecame an SFSP sponsor in Prince George’s County, MD for the first time in a decade.To make SFSP a success, we partnered with PG Parks and Recreation’sSafe Summer program, which provides teens a safe space to play basketball, create arts and crafts, and enjoy recreational activities.  Some community centers stay open as late as midnight.I am often surprised when I visit the sites.  While the staff is always excited to offer the meals to kids, and the kids are always happy to get healthy choices, they more often than not go straight for the fresh fruit.  I’ll be honest, kids are picky eaters and they don’t always like everything the food bank provides.  They eat what they like best, and on a hot summer day, surprisingly it’s fruit!Before we used SFSP, we served 142 children daily during the summer, andnow we reach 448 children a day.  Three times as many – and counting.  The trick now is to let families know this service is available, and making sure they know where the food is offered.When summer rolls around, you can easily locate an SFSP site. Just visitMD Summer Mealsfor MD sites andDC Hunger Solutionsfor D.C. sites. There will be more resources available closer to summer, just keep checking in with us.If you’re interested in learning more about the program, emailmwaddle@capitalareafoodbank.orgor call 202-644-9844.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

I hop from my stoop, eager to greet the day in a part of town newbies like me are calling NoMa.  A posse of preschoolers hoots at me from a jungle gym.  A parking attendant whistles as he puts out a cigarette.  My barista seems hurried, unapologetically calling the wrong name as she thrusts a cup of coffee at me that costs more than a third of the federal hourly minimum wage.  How many of the people in this coffee shop are aware of this?Our minimum wage in D.C. is automatically set at a dollar more per hour than the federal minimum wage.  Right now we’re ringing in at a whopping $8.25 an hour.  The most recent statistics available on wages from US Department of Labor are from May 2012.  At that time the mean income of, for instance, coffee shop counter attendants in D.C. was $9.12 an hour.  For our preschool teachers it was $13.26.  For that parking lot attendant it was $10.62.According toThe Council for Community and Economic Research, in 2012 Washington, D.C. had the eighth highest cost of living in the entire country. The payroll tax holiday that ended January 1st saved the average full-time minimum wage worker more than $300 over the course of a year.Theodate Desrivieres of Gospel Assembly Church manages a food pantry in Laurel, MD.  When asked about what that $300 a year could mean to his clients, he says, “Because of the economic situation right now, like taxes increasing, our clients are bringing less money home.  Any help we can offer to them is a blessing.  When we give them something, they don’t have to go and buy it themselves.  They feel more at ease and they can meet their budgets.”Now, more than ever, we are a metropolitan area in crisis.

Each of the recipes shows how kitchen staples can easily become budget-friendly, delicious dishes.Let’s walk through ourCorn and Black Bean Pizza Recipe (PDF)where we will discover, from ingredient to meal, the core principles of Healthy Eating on a Budget.Be Meal MindedA meal is made up of at least 3 food groups:\nSwitch it OutTo keep variety in check, focus on meals that incorporate fruits and/or veggies. A meal concept like a pizza can be broken down into component parts (crust, sauce, toppings), and each part can be substituted for other ingredients based on taste preference and what’s on hand. This also opens the door to food creativity:\nUse Versatile StaplesCanned tomatoes, black beans and canned corn are toppings for this pizza. These ingredients can also be used in dishes like soup, meatloaf and quesadillas. If you can think of three ways to use an ingredient off the top of your head, then it’s a good one to have on hand.Stretch IngredientsEating meat every night could strain a food budget, but stretching more expensive proteins across many meals make food dollars go further.  Adding two cooked chopped chicken breasts to this pizza, then saving the remaining package for later, is what stretching ingredients is all about.Protein RichWhen we think of cheese we often think “strong bones.” But cheese is a great source of protein, too, and can be less expensive than meat. Paired with the black beans, it gives this pizza a protein punch.Flavor it UpA little bit of a flavor-packed ingredient goes a long way. On this pizza, ½ cup of barbeque sauce is used for both sauce and to add flavor. This leaves more in the bottle for later which can be added to salad dressing, chili or dip.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Chairman Lucas points out that last year, he and his colleagues debated these issues and voted to pass the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act (FARRM) which would save $25 billion by reducing several Farm Bill Commodity programs by 30 percent.The major debate in the House Agriculture Committee was whether to reform the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps. Close to50 million Americansare eligible for SNAP, which provides grocery purchasing assistance to people who meet the federal requirements determined by the United States Department of Agriculture. The committee voted to remove state programs that increase SNAP benefits, and to stop federal incentives to states for getting eligible people signed up for the SNAP program. SNAP for college students has been limited, and the USDA will no longer be able to spend funds to advertise the program.Many anti-hunger organizations, including food banks, do not agree with the proposed cuts to the SNAP program. To this day, Congress has not reauthorized a new Farm Bill. It is the responsibility of the people to continue letting Congress know that SNAP is an important program and that we should not limit benefits to those who are eligible. Limiting benefits would cause an increase in hunger in the local area, as well as across our entire country.I would like to know about your experience with the SNAP program.

Withlooming federal budget cutsand a recovering economy, nonprofits have to find ways to clearly communicate their value to donors. Unlike for-profit companies, nonprofits cannot simply speak to their success through the “bottom line.” At nonprofits like the Capital Area Food Bank, we have to tell our story through a different lens.Some nonprofits fail because they are unable to effectively communicate the results of their work. After graduating from college, I took a job as a social worker connecting low-income families to community resources like food pantries and temporary housing. Building close relationships with clients was time consuming, but I found it to be the most critical element to my success. Unfortunately, it is not easy to quantify the value of relationship building and shortly after I began my work, the program lost funding.In the failure of the program, I saw opportunity. I went to graduate school and learned how nonprofits can clearly capture and communicate the vital impact they are making in the community on a daily basis.This personal investment in impact measurement led me to the Capital Area Food Bank: a nonprofit explicitly dedicated to measuring its community impact. The CAFB works hard to capture data that conveys its accomplishments. On average, the food bankdistributes33 million pounds of food to over 700 community partners each year. This translates into meals for 480,000 community members in need each year.The CAFB also tracks how its work impacts the well-being of each person struggling with hunger by measuring buy-in and support forhealthy food, the strength of community networks, and the operatingcapacityof partner organizations.Through impact measurement we will come to know as much about ourselves as we know about the communities we serve. This investment will open minds to new possibilities and doors to opportunity.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

When I came on as a volunteer at the Capital Area Food Bank, I thought I might be one of those people who wasn’t really needed, but got to see what was going on,” says Elizabeth Lohrmeyer of her work in her new city.Ms. Lohrmeyer is most definitely needed as part of theHealthy Eating Program, especially given her years of experience as a 4H Food and Nutrition teacher.“I love teaching kids how to cook and how to make healthy food choices,” she says. “It’s neat to see kids’ minds change about food despite their habits of eating food that’s not always healthy.”The same thing happens at the food bank, when people try recipes made from low-cost, healthy foods and are reminded just how flavorful healthy food can be.“They taste the new recipe, and say, ‘This is delicious! What’s in this?’ And when I tell them it contains brown rice, they say, ‘But I don’t like brown rice!’ Stuff like that happens all the time ,” Ms. Lohrmeyer says.“I love showing and serving the dishes and having conversations,” she says, noting that for her, volunteering was a good way to get to know the Washington DC region when she and her husband were transferred here from Seattle, WA.Her volunteer hours are spent offering Healthy Meal demonstrations to the community organizations which distribute food to the needy. She also takes part in theRecipe Testing sessionswhich go on in the teaching kitchen at the Capital Area Food Bank – a day spent tweaking recipes to make them easy and accessible to those who eat on a tight budget.“I grew up watching my mom volunteer and I have just always thought it is something we should all do.”", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Now attendance has increased tenfold. Who would have thought 10 years ago we could fill one of the largest ballrooms in the city?”Scher has been on the board of the Capital Area Food Bank since it opened its doors almost 33 years ago, and his labor of love has extended to being part of the organizing committee for the food bank’s biggest fundraiser of the year, theBlue Jeans Ball.The committee is made up of about a dozen professionals – lawyers, communications experts, architects and a wide variety of others – who donate their time, expertise and contacts to help the CAFB widen its circle in the community by hold a fun, inclusive tasting event.“If you’re into food, it’s a great event. This is a restaurant town. I mean, this isn’t Provost, Utah — it’s D.C.! We love food here,” jokes Scher.The head of Michael Dunn Associates Architects sat as chairman of the Blue Jeans Ball committee for three years, and cites working with the diverse crowd in the food bank community as what gives him most satisfaction.“Such a variety of people, and no matter their creed, race or sexual orientation, we all have one objective. Working to fight poverty is a wonderfully educational moment, no matter how you look at it,” Dunn beams.Dunn has been on the organizing committee for six years, sharing his insights, wisdom and expertise.“I was inspired by Lynn Brantley. She is the closest thing to a saint I have ever seen.”For over 32 years, Brantley was the visionary leader of the Capital Area Food Bank. Her warmth and devotion was palpable to anyone who worked with her. She retired as President and CEO in December 2012.The committee gets together every few weeks in the months leading up to the March 24 event. PR consultant Adam Shapiro is inspired by the outpouring of generosity of the supporters, and the sad reality that there is still a strong need to help the hungry in the DC area.“When I go in to a restaurant that supports the Blue Jeans Ball — any time of year — I thank them for helping the less fortunate,” says Shapiro. “With the staff they provide, and the food, under relatively hectic off-site conditions, they really deserve a huge thank you.”He knows the funds raised at the tasting event are well managed by the Capital Area Food Bank, but finds it heartbreaking to know that in one of the richest countries in the world, so many are still hungry.“I am bothered by the economic disparity in our community, and the truth is, our community has one of the widest disparities in any area of the country,” Shapiro says.Shapiro has been volunteering his time on the fundraising committee since 2005.“It’s a fun group of people. Ideas are appreciated just as much as the time or monetary donations when we sit around the table and come up with ideas on how to make the event bigger and better,” he says.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

{"title": "From Global to Local: Partnerships Are Critical to Success", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2013/02/11/from-global-to-local-partnerships-are-critical-to-success/", "date": "February 11, 2013", "content": "ByNancy E. Roman•February 11, 2013\nMoving from a job with theWorld Food Programme— the world’s largest humanitarian agency — to theCapital Area Food Bank, a local NGO, has afforded me a bright-line look at the advantages and challenges of global versus local. The global humanitarian arena allows for scale but little flexibility or agility. The local environment allows for just the reverse: we move swiftly, like a speedboat, toward the problem but must depend on others to scale up our best solutions and practices. But one common theme emerges for both: the importance of partnerships.\nWhether tackling hunger or clean water, disease eradication, literacy, or social justice, solutions to the great humanitarian and social problems of our day have eluded us. Both global and local hunger persist, despite the heroic efforts of many. And from both global and local vantage points, it becomes ever clearer that we urgently need to collaborate more effectively with our partners to meet the challenges we face.\nFor millennia, the human race has been finding ways to help others in need. But addressing social problems through agencies designed and built to tackle particular problems is a relatively new phenomenon. TheInternational Committee of the Red Cross, founded in 1863, is one of the earliest.United Nationsorganizations such asUNICEFand the WFP are but fifty years old. Many of the largest and best-known NGOs are even more recent players. Founded in 1980, the Capital Area Food Bank was created to end hunger in the Washington, D.C., metro area. Unfortunately, over the last thirty-three years, the need has not diminished. Poverty is on the rise, in our region and nationally. Indeed, we have witnessed a 25 percent increase in hunger since the beginning of the economic downturn in 2008. Today, more than 680,000 individuals, including 200,000 children, in the District of Columbia, northern Virginia, and Montgomery and Prince George’s counties in Maryland look to us for help. And while the ranks of the working poor are growing, the middle class is also under stress, as many people who have never needed emergency food services find themselves at the doors of our neighborhood partner agencies and food pantries, which depend on CAFB for food and household items.\nThere was a time when many of us looked forward to ending the scourge of hunger, poverty, and homelessness. But as days become months and months become years, these stubborn social problems have outlasted our commitment, our resources, and sometimes even our compassion. So we ask: Given that these problems are overwhelming and persistent, might not we fight them more effectively in partnership rather than alone? If that’s the case, how can we maximize impact through collaboration? And how should we think about these critical relationships?\nAt WFP, it became abundantly clear that our work, once deemed the purview of “donor governments,” required a broader set of players. Back then, I was focused on engaging the private sector, in particular, to join with government and civil society to more effectively reach hungry people around the world. During my five years with the UN, our unconventional thinking about public-private partnerships became conventional wisdom, as governments began to embrace the idea that they, too, needed partners — not just for additional funding but for the expertise that private-sector partners often are uniquely positioned to provide. As the UN partnered with Fortune 500 companies and governments to take on child malnutrition, the process of coordinating the work was always harder than we’d initially thought — yet always turned out to be more worthwhile than we’d expected.\nAt CAFB, our partners include not only private companies such asMarriottand philanthropic entities like thePhilip L. Graham Fund, but also hundreds of nonprofits, from local churches to areaYMCAstoMartha’s Table,Bread for the City, and other community groups. In working with these partners, however, we have come to realize that it is not enough to address immediate needs in our communities; we must also find ways to create a long-term plan to collaboratively and systematically tackle the problems we face.\nTo that end, I have just completed a round of conversations with forty or fifty agencies that are working with us to combat hunger in the region. CAFB’s role is to provide our partners with leadership, expertise, training, and food resources to meet the needs of children, seniors, and families in their areas of service. But as we think through the challenges of how to do this effectively, we are also mapping the food insecurity needs and the reach of our and our many partners’ efforts. When that effort is completed, we will be better positioned to empower and support the community agencies best suited to address these challenges.\nJust like leaders in the humanitarian aid field, we grapple with how best to work with our partners. Collaboration and information sharing is critical if we are to repair and weave stronger social safety nets that contribute to sustainable reductions in hunger, preventable diseases, and a host of other pressing problems.\nWe realize that collaboration, to be effective, will require an understanding of the comparative advantages of our various partners. It may also require bringing them together more often — not just to share best practices, but to plan better. Finally, it may require demanding answers to tough questions from all of us. Questions like: Which solutions are most effective? Which should be scaled first? Which should be phased out?\nIn the end, the best solutions are likely to be implemented street by street, block by block, one community at a time. At CAFB, we’re convinced that working with our partners to understand what works best and then to share best practices and scale solutions as we work toward our collective goals will make it more likely we achieve them.\nThis post was first published onPhilanthropy News Digest.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

For some, art may also provide a gateway to awareness and action.  The Capital Area Food Bank is fortunate to have support from local artists such asJane Callen.  When she’s not busy working her day job in the public sector disseminating data and promoting economic literacy, Callen can often be found in the hot shop, blowing glass.Callen took up hot glass in 2009. “Glass is magical,” she said.  “The material moves in and out of different physical states, at extremely high temperatures, using fire, a burbling cauldron full of molten liquid and primitive tools.  There is terrific beauty in its simplicity. And everything has to be done so very quickly – within seconds, really.  Hot glass is a great teacher about the value of the beginner’s mind, the need to be fully present, and humble. “Last fall, Callen’s work was featured at the CAFB’s annualEmpty Bowls event.  “The opportunity to create a glass bowl for Empty Bowls meant a great deal.  If one person’s actions can make even a small difference in increasing awareness, that matters.  Hunger, poverty, homelessness — these are not other people’s problems, they’re societal. Seeing our interconnectedness compels us to act, just as we would if our own family were starving or sleeping on the street,” she said. “The CAFB Empty Bowls event raises awareness using art is its voice. What a lovely concept.”When her son Devin was a child, they volunteered at the food bank’s partner agencies SOME and Martha’s Table.  Callen is also a hospice volunteer and EMT.Callen looks forward to getting more involved with the CAFB.  “Imagine a world where no one in our global family goes to bed hungry, where we open the gateway to addressing the myriad injustices of poverty.”  She said she is already planning the glass bowl she will donate for next year’s CAFB event.  “A radiant color, for hope…”The food bank is delighted to work with local artists.

Surprisingly, that dream world became my reality when The First Family and their immediate family volunteered at the Capital Area Food Bank on November 21, 2012.I will never forget the day when I was told that I would be the CAFB’s Logistics Lead for the event.  It was a great honor and also a chance to showcase my talents.  The event was a success and as a result I was chosen to be a volunteer lead for the Inaugural Parade.I couldn’t think of a better way to honor my President than to volunteer at the parade and participate in a historical event.  My fancy title for the day was Inside Access Control Captain, and I liked the way that sounded!  My excitement grew after a few trainings and site visits. I was a little concerned about being outdoors for over 10 hours in 30 degree weather, but the opportunity meant more to me than the fear of cold weather.The day of the Inaugural Parade was truly magical.  A sea of volunteers packed into the National Building Museum at 5:30 am with their red volunteer hats.  We were all there as a team to celebrate our President, no matter our backgrounds or differences.  It was truly a beautiful feeling.  Soon after I arrived, I received my neon green vest that matched nicely with my red hat and blue coat! That was not one of my most fashionable moments, but it was for a great cause.My favorite accessory of all was my credentials with my picture printed nicely on the front.  I knew then that I was really “official.”  I was responsible for managing my own section of ticketed guests on 10th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue and overseeing eight volunteers.  And I must say that I had the best section on the block.[flagallery gid=4 name=Gallery]That day had many rewarding moments. However, what stood out the most were the amazing volunteers, the PIC staff and the awesome people that came to see the parade.  Of course, seeing my President and First Lady walk down Pennsylvania Avenue with poise and grace was the ultimate highlight.  The crowd roared with screams as they walked passed chanting “OBAMA, OBAMA, OBAMA!”You may be surprised to know that I also had a chant of my own take place that day, “JANA IS THE BEST, JANA IS THE BEST.”  I think that made me volunteer of the day!

We’re still discovering treasures that were in that box,” she gushes. “There are resistors, capacitors and motherboards… stuff that artists and geeks look at and say, ‘This is so, so cool!’”Denim, meanwhile, has been cool for generations.

When I find myself shopping for groceries in January, my mind quickly wanders to memories of fresh springtime salad greens, juicy summer tomatoes and crisp, fleshy apples.Growing up in Iowa – the heart of our nation’s food growing region – seasonal, fresh produce was never out of reach. The same cannot be said for those living in poverty in the Washington metro region.  For those living in food deserts, access to produce is either inadequate or nonexistent.Fresh produce is valuable for its nutritional qualities and can influence healthy eating behaviors.  If you are a parent or have a finicky eater in your life, you may have recognized that because fresh, seasonal produce tastes better, it can help make fruit and vegetable converts out of the most vocal of veggie haters.For low-income communities, fresh produce can trigger a change in thinking about food and help address the growing problem of diet-related illnesses.The Capital Area Food Bank’s Fresh Produce Grant helps our partner agencies provide high-quality, local produce to their clients for a full farm season, providing nearly 40 different types of fruits and vegetables.Fresh produce grantees in Maryland and D.C. pick-up produce bi-weekly fromClagett Farmin Upper Marlboro, MD and Virginia grantees pick upWaterpennyproduce weekly from the food bank’s Northern Virginia branch.  As a part of the CAFB’s program, grantees are provided materials and support to educate their clients about the produce they receive.The innovation and creativity of recipient partner agencies has resulted in clients feeling empowered to prepare new foods and partners experience a renewed sense of community around healthier offerings.The application for the Fresh Produce Grant is nowavailable online.

So I guess that is my driving force,” says retired school teacher Mary Collins. “My career and my upbringing. That’s what makes me give.”During her 33 years of teaching math, Ms. Collins saw many children come to school hungry. She taught in Ward 8 of the District of Columbia for 19 years, with “wonderful, smart students” who were sometimes too hungry to concentrate.“You can just tell [when they haven’t eaten], they are irritable. They were in high school, and they would tell me, ‘I don’t feel like doing this work,’ ” Ms. Collins, 68, recalls.“I would ask, ‘What did you eat for breakfast this morning?’ They would say, ‘Nothing’ or ‘Potato chips.’ No wonder these kids aren’t alert! They haven’t eaten properly!”Ms. Collins has been sharing with the Capital Area Food Bank since 2010. She visited the food bank, and watched the teaching kitchen in action. She sees how families are taught about nutrition, and shown how to make low-cost healthy meals in minutes. She has made a pledge to donate $1,000 a year over the next five years.“I don’t believe that any child in our country should be hungry. That is shameful. How can I sit down and eat an entire meal — more than I should be eating — without sharing what I have with someone else?”Making sure children get healthy food is a priority for Ms. Collins. She says she supports the Capital Area Food Bank because it focuses on nutrition. She appreciates that the teaching kitchen can give working mothers the tools to learn how to make a nutritional meal in a mere 15 minutes.“Do you give food for the sake of giving food, or do you give healthy food?” The school teacher knows first-hand the importance of having protein and vitamins in one’s diet to enjoy strength and productivity. And because she is from the South, she knows how important food can be to a family’s sense of love and belonging.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

As a tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the founding date selected by the CAFB organizers was his birthday, January 15.Even though the food bank’s mission was to bring temporary relief to the hungry, the need continues to grow.  Today the CAFB reaches nearly 500,000 men, women and children in the Washington metro area each year who are at risk of hunger.In the early days, the food bank was a small operation providing 1,537 pounds of food per month to a few thousand people.  Today, the CAFB  has 130 employees and distributes 33 million pounds of food a year – half of which is fresh produce – through 700 non-profit partner agencies located in Washington, DC; Northern Virginia; and Prince George’s and Montgomery counties in Maryland.Due to the uncertain economy and the increasing numbers of those suffering from inadequate nutrition, the Capital Area Food Bank embarked on a capital campaign five years ago and moved into its new headquarters at 4900 Puerto Rico Avenue, NE  in late July.  Over time, the new food distribution center will enable the CAFB to more than double its storage and food distribution capacity to meet the growing need.Through the years, the CAFB’s mission has remained constant—to serve others ’til no one is hungry.

I know what it’s like to go to bed hungry,” remembers Paula Porter, 61.Ms. Porter was the eldest of eight children in a single-parent home. “My mother did a good job and she really did the best she could. But we needed help. Back then, we didn’t have food stamps. I remember calling it ‘commodities’: we would go down to the municipal building and pick up canned beef and ‘government cheese’. It wasn’t healthy, but we were hungry.”After more than four decades as a Human Resources Specialist, working at Bank of America for 26 years and then Amtrak for 16 years, Ms. Porter retired in November of 2011. She had been volunteering with a hospice care organization, but when she saw a news report on children in the DC area suffering from hunger, her childhood memories came back, and she knew she wanted to help.She is one of many skilled volunteers at the Capital Area Food Bank, and her 15 hours/week are spent recruiting other volunteers. She sees the possibilities in having people such as university students and retired members play a role in feeding the hungry.“I see through the food bank that people are getting help. The food bank provides nutritional information, and assists people in gaining access to healthy food. That is very important to me,” she says.Not only does Ms. Porter enjoy the feeling of giving back to the community, but she says her mother, 80, enjoys hearing her talk about volunteering at the Capital Area Food Bank.“She gets a reward out of seeing me give back! We reminisce about those days and we look at how far we’ve come. It humbles us. We figure if we can overcome poverty, then others will, too.”", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

The irrigation system is part of the facility’s expansive community growing program, where members of the community are encouraged to nurture and harvest fresh produce right in the CAFB’s garden.Ms. Jais-Mick was inspired by the community garden when she recently toured the CAFB’s new building and grounds on Puerto Rico Ave. NE in DC.“It will contribute to people doing things for themselves,” says Ms. Jais-Mick, who is the Director of Community Outreach and Volunteer Services at St. Elizabeths Hospital.The couple decided several years ago that it is better to give larger gifts to a few organizations. The impact is stronger, and recipients better match their ethical beliefs.“We give to the Capital Area Food Bank for two reasons: First, we have always trusted the leadership at the food bank. The board, the employees and of course, Lynn [Brantley]. Secondly, we have always appreciated that the food bank, besides addressing a very basic need, has focused on providing information and education to its partners about nutrition,” says Ms. Jais-Mick, who has been donating to the CAFB since 1993.“I used to work with people at the Green Door, and I always used to enjoy meeting other partners [who use the services of the CAFB]. They are not always big non-profits — they are organizations like small church and community groups, and that means the reach is as wide as it is deep.”Early on in the food bank’s existence, in the 1980s, she and her husband met the food bank’s co-founder Lynn Brantley. A friendship formed, each of them touched by the work and dedication of the other.“In our interactions with Lynn, we learned what [she and her team] were aiming for, their dreams, and what they were trying to do. Is there anybody who has worked harder, is more committed, more honest, caring or humble?”As Lynn Brantley retires after 32 years at the helm of the CAFB, gifts to the organization serve as proof that her legacy of both friendship and justice live on in the community thanks to donors such as Maureen Jais-Mick and her husband Daniel Mick.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

S. House of Representatives voted on January 1st to pass the American Tax Relief Act of 2012 by a vote of 257-167; following the Senate’s passage of the same bill the day before. The passage of this act allows for a one-year extension of the current Food, Conservation & Energy Act of 2008, known as the Farm Bill.  This legislation is not set to expire until the end of fiscal year 2013 in September.For Americans and food banks across the nation the passage of the American Tax Relief is good news. However, there is much work still to be done to ensure that our nation’s entitlement programs do not disappear or receive major cuts at the end of FY 2013.Congressional Republicans are moving forward to support cuts to programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Prior to the recent passage of the American Tax Relief Act, the U.S. Senate approved SNAP cuts of $4 Billion and the House called for cuts of $16 Billion. The proposed cuts will most likely include the removal of the employment training program which is under SNAP. This enables people to receive the help and assistance needed to not only find career opportunities, but to obtain the skills to maintain consistent success once in the workplace.Experts believe that cuts to the Farm Bill’s safety-net programs will occur after the one-year extension just approved by Congress and that Congress will probably have less funding for  a five-year Farm Bill reauthorization. Therefore, if there is less funding, there will be fewer dollars to put into the programs that people in need rely on to get them back on their feet. The question you are most likely wondering is, “how much should we expect in cuts?”  My answer to that is simple; don’t ask that question just yet. At this time you should contact your legislators, and encourage them to protect the safety-net programs in the Farm Bill.Will you take time towrite your legislators?  Please tell them your own personal story, and why the safety-net programs are important to you, your family, your neighbors, your friends and your co-workers.  And when you write please ask them not to cut the SNAP or TEFAP programs.Other important items included in the American Tax Relief Act:", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Roman as its new President and CEO.  Nancy succeeds Lynn Brantley, the food bank’s co-founder who retired at the end of 2012 after 32 years as its chief executive.Chosen unanimously by the CAFB’s Board of Directors, Nancy was the immediate past Director of Public/Private Partnerships and Communications at the United Nation’s World Food Programme (WFP), the world’s largest humanitarian agency, feeding 100 million people in 75 countries.Speaking on behalf of the CAFB Board of Directors, Chairman Greg Ten Eyck said, “Nancy Roman embodies the skills and experience necessary to continue the tradition of excellence and innovation so critical to the future of the Capital Area Food Bank.  Her success in raising awareness and resources for the fight against hunger worldwide is well-known and we are confident that her leadership and expertise will allow us to expand further to meet the  complex hunger needs in the region.”At WFP, Nancy supervised a global staff of more than 100 and pioneered innovative partnerships with the private sector that allowed WFP to expand services to millions more mothers and children in the poorest parts of the globe.“It is a great honor to be chosen for this important role and to follow in the footsteps of a visionary leader like Lynn Brantley,” she said.  “The CAFB is on firm footing and prepared for the future because of her leadership and inspiration. I’m so grateful she will continue to advise and support us as president emeritus.”The Capital Area Food Bank, a member of Feeding America, was founded in 1980 as a temporary hunger relief operation, but  poverty and hunger have continued to grow. Today, there are more than 680,000 individuals, including 200,000 children, in the region that look to the CAFB for help.Over the years, the CAFB has developed a comprehensive approach to addressing hunger by providing nutrition education and training; hosting hunger conferences; attracting some 18,000 volunteers to the food bank annually and advocating on behalf of those who rely on such programs as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).In response to the uncertain economy and the increasing numbers of those suffering from inadequate nutrition, the Capital Area Food Bank recently moved into a new and much larger food distribution center located at 4900 Puerto Rico Avenue, NE. Over time, the new facility will enable the CAFB to meet the growing need by more than doubling its storage and annual food distribution capacity of 33 milion pounds – half of which is fresh produce.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

But as the calendar year comes to a close, I want to focus on the positive.This year, the food bank had a lot of wonderful moments in Virginia. As part of the Federation of Virginia Food Banks, we benefited from theLegal Food Frenzy, theGovernor’s Bowland theHoliday Hoops Classic.  So many helped to bring the community together to collect food and funds to make sure that we could supply food to those in need in Virginia.

Other food drives, including Feds Feed Families, Boy Scouts, Washington Nationals and Washington Capitals contributed to our success.

In ongoing debates about the federal budget, SNAP continues to hold a central place because of its high cost, but should it constantly be at risk for cuts?SNAP is currently an expensive program simply because so many people are eligible based on income.  However as the economy and job situations improve, the numbers of people using the benefit will decrease as will the cost.Even in its present form, the money we’re spending on SNAP is an investment in the future, providing nutrition to children and adults and, thereby, reducing the risk for the multitudes of hunger-related social, economic and health issues they may face if unable to eat properly.Should a program that works to meet a basic human need be a target for cuts at the same time Congress is considering tax breaks for millionaires?The effects of hunger are preventable when we provide our neighbors with the resources they need to put nutritious food on the table, and right now SNAP is helping millions to do just that.

Hunger Lifeline phone is constantly ringing. We’re running around our office and warehouse, with so much cheer as we do our best to grant our clients with some of the things on their holiday wish lists. We realize that we may not be able to give Ms. Robinson that vacation she’s been wanting, but we can ensure that she will be able to have a full meal on Christmas day. Ms. Clayton may not be able to undue the fire that she and her children had to endure, but she has confidence knowing that she can call the Hunger lifeline and  get help finding a warm meal to feel her babies’ bellies. And although, we may not be able to take Ms. Clark off of furlough from her job, she knows that she can count on us to help her fill her fridge so that when her children go there, they don’t find it empty.Giving the gift of food to those families is the best feeling throughout the food bank. Every time we are successful in finding our clients a place that they can obtain food, it’s like Christmas morning. Every time we make a mobile pantry delivery, it’s Hanukah.

So as long as our community needs us, we will be here to share the gift of food, because our community is a gift to us.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}
{"title": "Lynn J. Brantley — In Appreciation", "url": "https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/blog/2012/12/11/lynn-j-brantley-in-appreciation/", "date": "December 11, 2012", "content": "ByPage Crosland•December 11, 2012\nSubmitted by CAFB Board of DirectorsNearly 32 years ago, the Capital Area Food Bank, which had been founded in 1980 on Martin Luther King, Jr.’s birthday, was a tiny organization facing an apparently insurmountable problem: hunger in the Nation’s Capital. Food stamps had been cut, inflation had been running in the double digits and poor people faced an increasingly bleak future.With an intrepid heart, sleeves rolled up ready to work and unburdened by either business experience, or a detectible ego, Lynn J. Brantley stepped into the role of heading the fledgling organization. Calling on the expertise and good will of others and driven by her own inner passion, she shifted the story of hunger in the Washington metropolitan area from one of largely unmet needs to the place it is today, still short of the goal of meeting all the need, but served by an organization that this year is distributing over 33 million pounds of food – half of which is fresh produce – through over 700 partner agencies to those facing hunger on a daily basis.Steadfast in her commitment to social justice and to the community she served, Lynn took the Capital Area Food Bank to leadership within the national food bank scene. With a plain style born of a Lancaster County, PA upbringing rich with Quaker values, Lynn spoke truth to power and time after time melted the hearts and opened the pocketbooks of people willing to join her in protecting the most vulnerable among us. She also touched the souls and spirits of those she met, making those around her better and kinder because of Lynn’s own example. She truly “Let Her Life Speak!”The Board of Directors of the Capital Area Food Bank, on the occasion of her final board meeting as President and CEO, included in the minutes its deep appreciation for the leadership that Lynn J. Brantley has provided to the organization and to each of us as human beings. We wish her the happiest retirement years, safe in the knowledge that those years will be spent serving others and brightening lives.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}

Virginia teams have appeared in Final Fours, won conference championships and are regularly ranked in national Top 25 polls. Unfortunately, given scheduling constraints and conference affiliations, we too rarely get to witness our in-state teams competing against each other. The ‘Classic’ will change that.”So, whose fans will be named winners: George Mason? University of Richmond? UVA? or Old Dominion University? The fundraising winner will be announced courtside at the Richmond Coliseum on the December 22nd, and supporters can make their donationsright now by clicking here.", "image_filenames": [], "image_links": []}
