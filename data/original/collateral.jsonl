The food bank currently does this \nin multiple ways.\nSourcing and distributing nutritious food\nFirst and foremost, we consistently work to provide \nhigh quality, nutritious food to those we serve. \nGuided by our organizational nutrition policy, \nthe CAFB utilizes a ranking system to review the \nnutritional quality of our inventory, ensuring that \na high percentage (currently 74% or greater) of \nthe foods we source and distribute are higher in fiber \nand lower in sodium and sugar. We also prioritize \nproduce; over 40% of our inventory is consistently \ncomprised of fruits and vegetables. Additionally, \nwe seek to continuously improve the variety, age \nappropriateness, and cultural relevancy of the \nfood that we make available.\nPiloting new mobile models for \nretail grocery access\nIn addition to the foods we provide, CAFB fosters \ninnovations that enable our neighbors to purchase \nnutritious foods closer to home. For many families \nin the greater Washington, DC area, a lack of efficient \npublic transportation is a barrier to shopping for \ngroceries, and thus to healthy eating. The food \nbank is working to address this through Curbside \nGroceries, a mobile grocery truck operated by the \nfood bank. Curbside brings a full market basket \nof items, including fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy, \nand seafood, to locations where many people are far \nfrom a traditional grocery store. This enables people \nto purchase groceries at the same price they would \npay in a major grocery store without the added \ncosts and delivery fees often charged by app-based \ngrocery delivery services. \n Advocating for government expansion of nutrition \nprograms and other food access initiatives\nOur advocacy work focuses on expanding the \nnumber of people who qualify for government \nnutrition programs, and on increasing and enhancing \nthe variety of foods offered through these programs. \nIn communities with a high prevalence of students \nutilizing free and reduced priced meals, the CAFB \nadvocates for this program’s expansion.
