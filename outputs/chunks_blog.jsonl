Whether you\u2019re looking to give back as an individual or with a group, visitvolunteer.capitalareafoodbank.org We worked to bridge the gap for children facing food insecurity by providing food when schools are closed, both during the summer time and year-round through our afterschool programs. We also made it more convenient for parents to access nutritious food, by hostingFamily Marketsat schools across the region. These programs ensure kids have the nutrition they need to learn, grow, and thrive.

These monthly events are more than just food distributions: they\u2019re a chance for the community to connect while taking home essentials for healthy meals. These Family Markets are part of a program of 112 markets coperated by the food bank in partnership with schools like Barnard to get healthy food to kids and families who need it most. Hosting the markets directly at schools makes it easier for families to access fresh produce and other nutritious groceries at a place they already visit frequently. Barnard Elementary\u2019s Family Market began last school year, initially serving around 90 families each month. Data from ourHunger Heat Mapshows that the school is located in an area with elevated levels of food insecurity, and school officials welcomed the monthly market as an additional resource for families who struggle to access enough food. Since the start, participation has steadily increased as more families and neighbors learn about the market. This November, roughly 170 families received food at the market, a testament to the need for accessible food. The market serves as a convenient, welcoming resource for busy families.

Growing up in an area with a high cost of living, Shauna says \u201cfood insecurity has been a constant presence\u201d in her life. And as a parent to three children with special needs, Shauna faces unique challenges that require her full attention as a caretaker, while her husband works full time to support their family. \u201cOne income, in this society right now, is really just holding on for dear life,\u201d Shauna says. Our latestHunger Reportfound that food-insecure residents in the Greater Washington region are just as likely to be employed as those who are food secure. The misconception that hunger is a result of not working hard enough is not reality and Shauna\u2019s story is a testament to this truth. Shauna strives to provide nutritious meals that meet her children\u2019s specific dietary needs, but balancing nutrition with affordability is a constant battle. Her and her husband sometimes make the difficult tradeoff to eat less so their children can have more. Shauna says groceries from the food bank and resources provided from other assistance programs make it possible to nourish her children in a way that might otherwise be out of reach. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the food banks, I know that my children may not have had the proper nutrition that they need,\u201d Shauna says.

This organization has become a lifeline for the growing Hispanic population in the area, offering not only food but also a sense of community and support. Founded in 2007 by Pastor Oliver Carter and his wife, Pamelia, No Limits Outreach started small, serving 20 to 30 people a week. As the need in the community grew, they partnered with the Capital Area Food Bank in 2017, expanding their operations to provide food for hundreds. After the pandemic, the organization moved to a permanent location in Landover, where they now distribute food several times a week. Every Friday, they serve around 500 people through a combination of appointments and walk-ups. This significant growth was fueled in part by advertising in neighborhood Facebook groups, specifically targeting the Latino population with posts in Spanish. To improve their processes, a capacity grant from CAFB helped No Limits implement a texting system, allowing clients to join the line virtually and return when food is available. The grant also enabled them to offer additional services, including financial assistance and English classes, while securing a larger freezer to store more of the proteins that are in high demand, such as chicken. With the community they serve being predominantly Hispanic, Pastor Oliver recognized a growing language barrier.

For our next feature, we head to Alexandria, VA, to highlight Mother of Light Center, a 100% volunteer-run organization dedicated to both meeting basic needs and uplifting education throughout their community. Founded in 2019, Mother of Light Center serves a predominantly Hispanic community, including many clients who have immigrated from Central and South America. Their mission is holistic, focusing on feeding, clothing, supporting, and nurturing those in need. In addition to food distribution, they offer a wide range of services, including support groups for single mothers and after-school programs for children. Since opening, Mother of Light has partnered with the Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) to operate a food pantry that serves more than 1,500 families every month. The pantry\u2019s food comes both directly from the Capital Area Food Bank and through connections with grocery stores like Amazon Fresh, made possible by the food bank\u2019s Partner Direct program. The food is distributed in two ways: through home deliveries and direct pick-up at the center. With 70% of the food delivered by van to local neighborhoods, the pantry ensures that food is as accessible as possible.

For Rosalind, now a senior, it\u2019s no longer that simple to find fresh, delicious produce. The DC resident says, without direct access to a garden, she struggles to get the fruits and vegetables she loves. When she goes to the grocery store, Rosalind is shocked to see how much the price of produce has increased. And the higher prices don\u2019t always mean higher quality: at her nearest store, she often finds that the cucumbers are soft, and the tomatoes lack taste.

Supporting local growers and sourcing local produce for our clients are key parts of our mission. In Virginia, those local growers include Cornell \u201cBrick\u201d Goldman, whose farm is part of a food hub that aggregates crops from 15 different growers to help farmers reach new markets.

Father Brake, a cherished member of the CAFB community for decades, was among the interfaith leaders who recognized a growing need for emergency food in the region following significant cuts to government assistance programs in the late 1970s. With grit and determination, Father Brake and others, including CAFB\u2019s first CEO Lynn Brantley, set to work gathering food from local grocers and growers, and distributing it to those in need. Together they laid the groundwork for CAFB to open its doors \u2013 with great intention \u2013 on Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s birthday in January of 1980. Father Brake was a tireless champion for the needs of people in low-income communities. Growing up in poverty in Delaware, he later devoted his life to the service of those experiencing hunger and homelessness in the Washington region, working and often living in the places of greatest need. He was a man of great faith, and also a man of great action.

That\u2019s unacceptable, and alongside nearly 100 leaders of key organizations involved in addressing food access for DC seniors, we met to talk about how to better collaborate to address this issue. Seniors often have limited income, making it difficult to afford food and other expenses like rent and medicine. They may not have access to transportation to grocery stores where they can access nutritious food, and they are more likely to have chronic health conditions that make cooking and grocery shopping difficult.But through collaboration, we can better ensure that those who have given so much can access the food they need.

{"text": "Bycafb\u2022May 29, 2024 What does it mean to be opening a new distribution center that is nearly four times larger than our original Lorton facility? It means that the food bank\u2019s Northern Virginia operations team will no longer have to play Tetris when they are unloading deliveries, rearranging pallets to make enough space to move in more food. It means storage racks that previously stretched just two pallets high now are much taller, with the capacity to store five pallets of food. And it means much more space in the cooler and the freezer, which will allow for distributing far more fresh produce and frozen protein to our neighbors. These features will not only allow the food bank to better serve our neighbors in Northern Virginia, they will also make distributing food across the region more efficient. With more truck bays, the facility in Lorton will be able to receive more food directly instead of receiving food that\u2019s initially delivered to our main warehouse in Northeast DC. That will also increase capacity at our DC warehouse to get food out to partners in the District and in Maryland. The expanded cooler will now hold up to 468 pallets of food \u2014 nearly 10 times what could be stored in the old cooler. That will allow the food bank to source and distribute increased quantities of nutritious produce and protein. It will also enable CAFB to purchase more fresh food from our region\u2019s local farmers, enabling our clients to access more items that were grown right here in the Greater Washington", "source": "blog_posts", "title": "Getting to know our new NOVA facility: more capacity to meet the need", "doc_id": "blog_posts_025", "chunk_id": 0, "date": "May 29, 2024"}

Capital Area Food Bank:Temple Sinai Women of Reform Judaism has fundraised online for the High Holidays for the past four years. What inspired you to start the online fundraiser in 2020? Michelle:We used to have a food drive on Yom Kippur morning, and after the morning services, the Capital Area Food Bank would pick up all of the cans and boxes. That gradually got bigger but became so huge and difficult to coordinate. As I learned more about CAFB and the best way to serve the people experiencing hunger, I learned how much better it would be if we donated money so CAFB could purchase the food at a much better rate. So I started doing a combined food and fund drive before the COVID-19 pandemic, and then during the pandemic, with services and everything on Zoom, it was really easy to make the transition to an online fund drive. I think it worked out really well and it\u2019s taken off now. CAFB:Yom Kippur is the Day of Atonement in the Jewish faith, with many choosing to fast for the day.

{"text": "ByJosh Mays\u2022June 15, 2023 The school year is ending, and for thousands of kids in the Greater Washington region, summer break means hunger. When school cafeterias are closed, children may have a more difficult time getting the food they need to play, grow, and thrive. \u201cIt is more challenging for parents who \u2026 can only pay for rent and maybe some foods, and now they have to think about, \u2018Oh, now I gotta feed my child breakfast, lunch and dinner,'\u201d says Josie Valdez, property manager at Audubon Estates, a Fairfax County housing community where the food bank distributes summer meals. Food insecurity is a significant problem among children in the Washington region.

Together, representatives from the St. Paul\u2019s Episcopal Church and St. Katharine Drexel Catholic Church formed the Haymarket Regional Food Pantry.

One important way that we keep an eye on the health of the food we distribute is through an inventory ranking system. As products come into our warehouses, we assess them based on salt, sugar, and fiber content, and give them each a score. Foods that meet thresholds for being higher in fiber and lower in salt and sugar are considered \u201cwellness foods\u201d because they\u2019re more likely to contribute to overall health. Last year,88% of the foods CAFB assessed for nutritional value were classified as contributing to wellness. The vast majority of the items made available to our clients are foods that can help make up a healthy diet! The wellness ratings on our foods are shared with partner groups that order groceries from our warehouse, allowing them to see the nutritional value of the items they access through CAFB. Our partner organizations also receive an annual wellness score for the inventory they\u2019ve ordered, giving them greater visibility into how the foods they provide contribute to the health of those they serve.

The first gathering of its kind in more than 50 years, the conference was an important moment to talk about the next steps for addressing hunger and health in America. Bringing together leaders on food security and nutrition from across the country, the September 28 gathering sought to coordinate strategies across the public, private, and social sectors for ending hunger and increasing healthy eating. Embedded throughout that day\u2019s discussions were key concepts fromthe Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition and Health: end hunger by making it easier to access and afford food; prioritize the role of nutrition in overall health; and increase access to healthy foods to enable individuals to make healthy choices. Those themes affirmed the value and strength of the strategic initiatives that the food bank and others have been pursuing across the greater Washington region for several years, including work focused on creating greater equity, increasing food access and affordability, and improving health outcomes through nutrition support. The White House conference created the potential to accelerate work in several of the food bank\u2019s strategic focus areas, particularly through discussions about: In addition to providing a platform for sharing strategies, the White House conference was also a fantastic opportunity to connect with our partners in this work, both from across town (including chef and World Central Kitchen Founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s) and from across the country.

We chatted for a while longer about the foods she liked. She was considering the vegetables on her plate, saying she liked them \u201cok\u201d and deeming them mostly edible. But pizza and tater tots, she said, were much more her speed. After a few more bites, she ran off for more play. As the evening wound down I said goodbye to my table companions and headed out. Driving home, I was filled with gratitude at having been able to connect with so many people that evening. I was also filled with resolve.

That overall rate means thatmore than 1.2 million people across the region didn\u2019t know where their next meal was coming from at some point during 2021. In some counties, nearly half of all residents experienced food insecurity at some point last year. In every county, at least one in five people faced challenges getting enough to eat. The breathtaking findings in our new survey are the first publicly available information about the scale of food insecurity in the Greater Washington region during the past year. Together, the responses underscore how the long-standing inequities across our region were exacerbated by the pandemic\u2019s uneven economic effects.

A 60-year-old resident of Ft. Washington, Md., Conley had been working as an activity coordinator at several assisted-living facilities in March 2020. The dangers of the newly emerging virus meant gathering in common areas was no longer an option. That was particularly true for vulnerable older residents like those at the facilities where Conley worked. That meant Conley was no longer able to carry out her role bringing residents together. She applied for unemployment benefits, which provided some financial support until the emergency benefits ran out in September. Now, two years after being forced from her job, Conley has exhausted her savings. To get by, she has relied on assistance from food pantries and a network of friends. For Conley , the food insecurity she encountered after she was no longer able to go to work was new. She describes herself as someone who has always been able to make meals out of whatever she had. Now a member ofCAFB\u2019s Client Leadership Council, Conley is searching for a new job.

Name:Dr. Arethusa KirkRole:National Senior Medical Director for Community and State, UnitedHealthcareFavorite Food:Honeycrisp apples What are some of the experiences that have shaped you career and stayed with you over the years? I was inspired to become a pediatrician by my experiences with significant poverty and food insecurity as a young person. It\u2019s those foundational experiences that inform my patient care today and help me bring a foundational empathy into clinical practice when assisting patients and their families, whether that is directly in the clinical setting or through administrative leadership. Prior to going into medicine, I spent time volunteering abroad, and that time was also formative for me. In India, for instance, I saw a different scale of need and abject hunger and poverty than I had ever witnessed before. Perhaps most striking was the juxtaposition of significant poverty living alongside incredible wealth and technological innovation.

{"text": "Bycafb\u2022May 5, 2021 Planned giving is visionary thinking. It means that, as a donor, you can help the food bank meet future needs that may not occur during your lifetime. A planned gift can also save money spent on taxes, increase your spendable income, preserve your assets, allow you to continue to use your assets during your lifetime, and more importantly help make a difference in the lives of those struggling to get enough food to eat. With a simple provision in your will that can be of any size comfortable to you, you join a group of committed supporters who are helping to secure the financial future of the CAFB and ensure that all have access to good food today and brighter futures tomorrow. Although we both know what it feels like to be hungry, it\u2019s never because we don\u2019t have enough to eat. Like many others in our country, our experiences of hunger have been limited to occasions when circumstances have caused us to delay a meal, or even miss one entirely. Yet, we have always been secure in knowing that food would soon be available, so no experience of our hunger has ever become a sour of pain or suffering in our lives. But what is it like for people in circumstances when food is not so assuredly available? And worse, what is it like for people when food is never reliably available at all?

In honor of Giant\u2019s 85thanniversary on February 6, we are reflecting on just some of the ways they have been \u2013 and continue to be\u2013 the best kind of friend. Like the food bank, Giant touches almost every neighborhood in the greater Washington area. And from the time that the food bank opened our doors in 1980, they have been a rock-solid partner in helping those who call our region home get the food they need to thrive. They are our single largest in-kind food donor, providing substantial amounts of critically needed protein and other food items.

Each year up to 24 individuals who live in the food bank\u2019s service area will receive professional training through the CLC, enabling them to advocate on behalf of themselves and their communities, and serve as effective agents of change. We spoke with Odessa Davis, one of the CLC\u2019s newest members, to learn what inspires her to raise her voice for change. Over the past four years, Odessa Davis has been busier than ever.

{"text": "ByRadha Muthiah\u2022March 8, 2020 As a girl, I remember visiting my grandmother in India. At the end of a meal she would offer food to the women who worked in her home, knowing most of them had very limited economic means. She also knew that the food that went home would almost always go to their husbands and children first, and that they would eat last. So my grandmother always insisted they eat before they left for the day. Later, as a grown up working in international development across several countries, I saw these same patterns over and over. I heard stories from women of saving a tiny wedge of a candle so a daughter could finish her homework while the men and boys in the village watched a movie on the communal television. Or of saving up some food in the folds of her outfits to provide to her children later, even if she hadn\u2019t eaten that day. Women consistently had less and sacrificed more. Now, working back in the US, the scenes are different but the themes are too often the same. Nearly 15 million family households in the United States are headed by women. For a variety of reasons, including a persistent wage gap between the genders, about 26 percent of those families, or 3.9 million family households, have incomes that fall below the poverty level.

She led lessons and developed individualized learning plans to assist each student. After school, she poured her time into her family and to the many causes she supported through service. But one day, her eyesight began to wane. A bit at first and them more significantly, the result of a degenerative disease. The diagnosis changed everything. Her ability to teach and the frequency at which she could volunteer started to diminish. Eventually, she was unable to drive and was forced to retire. The benefits she received weren\u2019t enough to cover her essential living costs, and she was soon confronted with the choice between paying bills and buying groceries. Wanda wasn\u2019t sure what to do. She felt mounting discouragement. But as her worry grew, her years of work as a volunteer prompted a clear thought in her mind:look to your community for help. It was a thought she heeded. On the recommendation her church, Wanda connected with Landover Hills Baptist Church, a partner of the Capital Area Food that operates a weekly food pantry known as Feed My Sheep.

To address the root causes of hunger and inequity in our region, we need new and innovative approaches.Food can be a powerful catalyst for change and for more inclusive economic growth that begins to address our region\u2019s inequities.Our next stage of work will seek to harness that power. Different people need and prefer different kinds of food based on age, culture, and dietary needs. That\u2019s why we\u2019re focusing on ways to better address client needs, from offering more prepared food options for seniors who may have limited ability to cook to offering more culturally appropriate options for different kinds of families. By taking these things into consideration, in the form of both ingredients for cooking and prepared meals,we\u2019ll be able to support more customized dietary needs, reduce risks of poor health outcomes, and measure the the impact of better quality food on people\u2019s lives. Having access to healthy food throughout your life makes all the difference. The food bank\u2019s reach across the community is wide \u2013 but there are many parts of our region where both a lack of full-service grocery stores and brick and mortar nonprofit partners make physically getting to food a challenge.

This year was no exception. As we walked though each goal set and achieved, and the sometimes-surprising twists and challenges on the path there, the sense of pride was evident throughout the room. The team knows the same thing that I do: 2019 was a remarkable year in multiple regards. Not the least of these was that it started with an entirely unprecedented government shutdown. January stretched the food bank in new ways as we mobilized ourselves and our partners to support the thousands of federal workers and contractors that were suddenly in need of emergency assistance \u2013 most for the first time in their lives. That 35-day period held many lessons. Among them: that far more of our neighbors are one paycheck away from hardship than we could have possibly imagined; that a social safety net is critically important for those who fall on difficult times; and that our team and community can solve big challenges when we come together to support our neighbors. The lessons of the shutdown also reinforced the thinking underlying the new five-year strategic plan that we rolled out later that winter. To build a stronger community, we must assist with meeting people\u2019s immediate needs whilealsoworking to strengthen their longer-term financial stability.

I was one of those people who considered hunger a distant reality that I had never encountered. I grew up sheltered from those realities, and my mother protected me from ever experiencing them. However, throughout my time at the CAFB as the Hunger Lifeline Intern, many of my preconceived notions were challenged. In my first week at the food bank, I shadowed different departments to understand the processes that go into running programs smoothly. I was most impacted by my ride-along with a truck driver. We distributed food to a partner site, and later picked up food donations from a Safeway warehouse. When we arrived at the partner site, I was surprised to see the long line wrapped around the outside of the church with people waiting to receive their food.

In honor of National Volunteer Month, here are five amazing things our volunteers helped accomplish this past year! 1. Packed 25 million total pounds of food food \u2013 enough for 20 million meals \u2013 for those in need. This past year, more than 20,000 volunteers streamed through our doors to help pack bags, sort food, and pack produce for the community, allowing us to save millions of dollars in labor costs that can instead be used to source and procure more food for those in need. Our volunteers contributed over 50,000 volunteer hours throughout the year and helped pack 25 million total pounds of food, which translates to 20 million healthy meals for the community. 2. Helped the food bank operate 10 direct distribution programs. While the food bank works with a network over 450 other nonprofit partners, we also bring food directly into the community through several direct distribution programs.

{"text": "Bycafb\u2022April 5, 2019 In a land of abundant food, there is also abundant waste. In fact, 40% of the food produced in the United States goes uneaten. To be a part of the solution to this problem, the food bank has made reducing food waste a core tenant; it\u2019s part of our organizational DNA. Here are a few ways the food bank works to reduce food waste and help more people get access to the nutritious food they need. How We Reduce Food Waste in Our Region The food bank\u2019s model is to make sure that retailers or others who have an excess supply of good, nutritious food can make it available for people in need, rather than discarding it. Much of that food comes to the food bank directly. But when retailers have smaller amounts of food to donate (a few crates of milk, or a few boxes of frozen vegetables), it is not feasible for the stores to send trucks to the food bank, so it becomes more likely the food gets wasted. A few years ago, these grocers looked to the food bank for assistance. Our solution: working smarter by making a direct connection between our network of nonprofit partners and our retail donors. Through our partner direct model, 60 of our partners in DC, MD and VA pick donations up right from grocers. The results: transportation costs are saved for both the food bank and the grocer, and millions of pounds of good food from 238 retailers makes it way to", "source": "blog_posts", "title": "Inside Look: How Fighting Hunger Also Helps the Planet", "doc_id": "blog_posts_211", "chunk_id": 0, "date": "April 5, 2019"}

One of these partners is Miller Farms of Clinton, Maryland. Owned and operated by the Miller Family since 1840, the farm has been an important part of getting produce to the men, women and children we serve. Brad and Phil Miller are quick to share their reasons for partnering with the CAFB. Brad talks about his own experience witnessing people who don\u2019t know how to prepare fresh vegetables. \u201cPeople lose sight of nutritious produce due to quick access to [fast] food \u2026 that temporarily fills us up, but lacks the nutrients to sustain a diet,\u201d Brad says. \u201cIf we decide to eat healthy on a regular basis, I believe we wouldn\u2019t have a lot of the health issues we have.

Accumulated stress injuries to her back and hands precluded her from continuing to work full time, so she took on a part-time job doing office administration work at a temp agency. With the part-time job and benefits she had accrued from her time at the utility company, Pam was set for retirement. Then her father, a World War II veteran, needed caring for, and she moved him into her house. It was an adjustment, but nothing compared to the change that would happen shortly thereafter. Her niece, while working to her overcome substance abuse issues, asked if her three high-spirited children could come to live with Pam. Suddenly, the house was filled with two boys and one girl, ages 7, 9, and 12. Whether they were worrying about math tests, upcoming sports games, or the gossip going around their middle school classrooms, they were almost always talking or running around the house.

A couple of blocks from NPR, adjacent to shiny new condos/apartment buildings, but also adjacent to a street with boarded up houses. You could hear the sounds of construction a few blocks away. What an apt reflection of DC today.It was an amazing sight to see people of all cultures, standing in line as early as 5 am, with people chaining their shopping carts to the railing on the side of the street. The lines wrapped around two, maybe even three city blocks before the market opened.As I walked through the line I saw a true reflection of this global city: Chinese women doing their morning stretches; Chinese men sitting down playing a card game; a woman of Middle Eastern descent with a head scarf tending to her baby; an African American woman in her wheel chair waiting with her bag perched on her lap; and members of a church on the street handing out some water and allowing those in line to use their restroom.Back at the market, volunteers were putting up tents, standing up tables, starting to take onions from a 50 pound bag and dividing them into smaller containers. Our CAFB driver James was moving bottles of almond milk from the truck on a fork lift, registration forms were being lined up, and menu cards were being stacked.

He draws on the work of Nobel-prize winning economist Kenneth Arrow, who said that market forces fail in the area of health care because of \u201ca huge mismatch of power and information between the buyer and the seller.\u201d You can easily walk away from a car salesman\u2019s pitch and buy another kind of car, for example, or choose simply not to buy a consumer good like a hairbrush.

But as I discovered the pervasiveness of hunger in this affluent region \u2013 the sheer number of children, minimum-wage workers, low-income seniors, and others without access to good food on a regular basis \u2013 I was stunned. I felt I had to do something to help slash this number.I want to be part of the solution in the fight against hunger. By giving to the food bank, I know that I am.

Alleviating hunger not only makes a big difference to a family right now, but it also lays a foundation for education (if you are a hungry child you can\u2019t concentrate in school); for senior health (if you are a hungry senior, your medications are less effective); and for employment (if you are a hungry man or woman, it is hard to get and keep work).

She believed that by providing nutritious food, her family would stay well and not have to visit the doctor as frequently. So she started to explore creative food sourcing strategies.After learning that many grocery stores donate products close to expired dates to churches and other non-profits, Ester worked with her church to be able to collect food from local grocery stores that was past peak freshness but still healthy and good to eat. Soon, Esther and her family were picking up surplus food from area grocery stores on a weekly basis.Over time, Esther started collecting more food than her family could use. In an effort not to waste anything, the family often stopped at parks while driving back home to Maryland to share food with some of Washington\u2019s homeless residents.

The next day, much of that food was headed for the homes and plates of families throughout the region.These volunteer hours were just some of the many that Morgan Stanley groups have logged during the last 14 months, sorting thousands more pounds of food that ultimately reached men, women, and children in need.The dedication that Morgan Stanley and its employees show is a humbling reminder of the role the community and partnerships plays in making our work possible.

By partnering with Shoppers Food and Pharmacy to take meals on the road.Last summer, CAFB collaborated with Shoppers to retrofit a school bus to bring meals to children in areas of in Northern Virginia where there are few or no resources nearby.

We distributed those pounds on the map based on where food insecure individuals live, taking into account their access to a car or public transportation.The map\u2019s third layer overlays the first two pieces, showing how each area\u2019s need and the food distributed there line up.It is the map\u2019s final layer that is setting a course for the food bank\u2019s future work.

Radio Health Journal dida storyrecently about food insecurity on the national and local stages, and brought in experts to talk about it. Our very own Susan Topping, Senior Director of Partners and Programs at the Capital Area Food Bank, was on hand along with Ross Fraser of Feeding America, the national network of food banks. Joining them for the discussion was Leanne Brown, author ofGood and Cheap: How to Eat Well on $4 a Day, to offer a culinary perspective on how people with limited food budgets can still eat healthily. For the majority of the people served by the food bank, the type of food they are forced to choose for themselves and their families is unfortunately more quantity over quality. As Ross Fraser of Feeding America says in the radio story, \u201cWhat they have to do is worry about filling bellies in their households without worrying about the consequences of the food.\u201d In many cases, this can often lead to obesity, hypertension, heart disease and other health complications that are related to one\u2019s diet.

The Capital Area Food Bank believes that food is inextricably, fundamentally linked to health. That\u2019s why we offer a program called Cooking Matters. Just one of our many education programs offered to our partners and clients, Cooking Matters teaches the basics of health and nutrition in the context of the kitchen.

Well, Iwasskeptical up until recently.While any kind of canned protein is a wellness boon for the kitchen cupboard, my mind couldn\u2019t move beyond the canned part of canned chicken. Even as a lifelong canned tuna and salmon eater, in my mind chicken was set apart from its canned protein cousins. So I decided to challenge this culinary mental block and added a few cans to my grocery cart.Armed with the Capital Area Food Bank\u2019s ownrecipe for Curried Chicken Salad, I stood over the kitchen counter and forked the contents out into a bowl. Then I mixed the chicken with chopped onion, curry powder, chopped apple and mayo.The verdict: delightful. The sweet notes of the apple, curry and mayo fit perfectly with the meaty chicken flavor. And the creamy texture combined with crunchy apple kept the mouth entertained; grapes are an alternate fruit option that would work just as well. The fruit and onion add-ins stretched the chicken and made the recipe go farther, upping the recipe\u2019s affordability. I spread some on a piece of bread, topped the open faced sandwich with cheese, and we all melted.

Yes, this was anactual headlinein the A section of the Washington Post this morning. On the one hand, it seems like a pretty obvious point to make the above-the-fold news cut. On the other, maybe this is a good thing. The long overdue connection between food and health is breaking through. Looking at the latest statistics in the article, there is good reason: 31 percent of kids in the Americas are obese. That number rises to near 40 percent in Europe. And there were several paragraphs about how fatty foods \u2013 though high in calories \u2013 are not high in the satiety that they produce. In other words, they don\u2019t fill you up. So kids eating a bag of chips are getting lots of energy (which gets stored as fat when it isn\u2019t used), but they might finish the bag still hungry. Which gets me back to my refrain: At CAFB, we are working to make sure those kids have access to vegetables and protein.

The American Academy of Pediatrics \u2013 in other words, real, live health care professionals \u2013 have recommended that pediatricians screen all children for food insecurity. If medical professionals heed their cry, we will see an acceleration of the movement to prevent disease through diet and nutrition education. It will also help us to catch hunger earlier, when its effects are most insidious and damaging to children who struggle to get enough food. Health problems linked to hunger in the AAP policy statement include (and I will quote directly): \u2022 Children who live in households that are food insecure, even at the lowest levels, get sick more often, recover more slowly from illness, have poorer overall health and are hospitalized more frequently. \u2022 Children and adolescents affected by food insecurity are more likely to be iron deficient, and preadolescent boys dealing with hunger issues have lower bone density. Early childhood malnutrition also is tied to conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life. \u2022 Lack of adequate healthy food can impair a child\u2019s ability to concentrate and perform well in school and is linked to higher levels of behavioral and emotional problems from preschool through adolescence.

According toa study released this week and covered in today\u2019s Washington Post, overall hunger in developing countries has fallen 27 percent in the last 15 years. It has been halved in 17 countries. That is indisputably good news. The article rightly focuses on the 44 countries who still have too many malnourished citizens. But there is one thing it doesn\u2019t mention that we cannot lose sight of. While the calorie deficit has been almost fully addressed in the developed world, far too many low income people here and across the country aren\u2019t able to access the right kind of food. They must often rely on fast, cheap calories that stave off a growling stomach but deliver very few nutrients. The result is an insidious, often invisible kind of hunger, defined by chronic undernourishment, obesity, and diet-related illnesses like diabetes and heart disease. A teen who eats a honey bun for breakfast, fast food for lunch, and a bag of chips for dinner, for example, will spend about $7 for food. Along with very high amounts of salt and sugar, she will consume more than the kilocalories necessary to produce energy for a day, some of which will likely be stored as fat.

{"text": "ByDr. Ray Solano\u2022October 8, 2015 Growing up in the DC metro area, you are exposed to a lot. When I was a little boy, my parents would drive through our nation\u2019s capital and I often wondered why some people were less fortunate, and whether they had enough to eat. The thought would break my heart, but I knew that one day I would be in a position to help. I am a firm believer that action is a cause set in motion, and that cause produces an effect. So about 8 years ago, my wife and I decided to put together an event for patients in our medical office that would help collect food donations for the Capital Area Food Bank. In just two years, the event outgrew our office space. We later moved to nearby restaurants in an effort to include more of the community and the event has since taken off. With the help of patients, local athletes, news media, local schools, chambers of commerce, family and friends, this event continues to grow. To date we have raised over $10,000 for the Capital Area Food Bank and collected approximately 10,000 pounds of food. Today kicks off my 8th Annual Food Drive Event for Capital Area Food Bank. It\u2019s an event close to my heart for many reasons, but primarily because it takes care of those less fortunate right here in our own backyards.

Over the years, I have come to think of these food racks as a giant oversized medicine cabinet. A medicine cabinet that helps build a foundation for wellness, both individually and collectively. Food with the potential to help those struggling with diet related illness, to gain control over their own wellness (in my short stint as a diabetes counselor, I was always amazed when clients\u2019 blood sugars normalized after making small food and lifestyle changes). So when the food bank amped up efforts to focus on wellness three years ago, it was decided we would take a long hard look at our food through the lens of salt, sugar and fiber, to see how well the food stacked in the distribution center stacked up to wellness.

Giant Food has proven, once again, what an outstanding friend it is for the Capital Area Food Bank and for the community by providing 4 truckloads of food at a critical moment. On a morning walk through our distribution center earlier this week, I noticed something that is an uncommon sight here at the Capital Area Food Bank \u2013 empty racks. Lots of them. At most times throughout the year, generous donations from retailers, farmers, food drives, and other members of the community keep our supply of food steady. Due to the timing of a few major summer food drives, however, we were low on food this week. And hunger doesn\u2019t take a vacation. I reached out to Giant, a longtime supporter of the food bank, to see if they could help us bridge the gap between the summer season and the start of the fall, when we see an uptick in donations. The response was swift and incredible. \u201cWe can send four trailers of food. Today, if you can handle them\u201d. Only hours later, the trucks were scheduled for delivery.

Though they won last year\u2019s U.S. Open Cup Championship, their league record hit a historic low. If D.C. United, one of Major League Soccer\u2019s most accomplished teams, wanted back into the playoff picture, they needed to exorcise any lingering 2013 demons.And exorcise they did. This year, D.C. United are unstoppable. Thanks to the leadership of Coach Ben Olsen and contributions from players up and down the roster, D.C. United currently sits in first place in the Eastern Conference and only a few points away from winning the Supporters Shield (best record in MLS).Coming off a road win in Houston, D.C. United looks to continue to ride that success into Saturday\u2019s matchup against the Chicago Fire. Though D.C. United has already clinched a playoff spot, this game has tremendous implications. For starters, it will ensure United wins the Eastern Conference. In addition, the 12thman has a huge opportunity to help so many at risk of hunger in the Washington metro area.The Capital Area Food Bank and D.C. United, through United Drives, will collect non-perishables before Saturday\u2019s match. The CAFB/United Drives booth is located outside of RFK Stadium\u2019s Gate A and will open an hour and a half prior to kickoff, closing 15 minutes into the first half.Any fan donating", "source": "blog_posts", "title": "D.C.

I never thought I could raise hunger awareness during my lunch hour.Empty Bowls is the CAFB\u2019s annual event that brings together those in the community through art, a bowl of soup and a desire to solve hunger \u2013 for a minimum donation of $25. Handcrafted bowls were created by local artist and delicious soups were prepared by local chefs.It was very difficult to choose a bowl between the variety and beautiful handcrafted options.After browsing through the bowl selections, it was time to experience savory soups provided by the restaurants. All of the soups were tempting and delightful, and it became very difficult to just try one. So I decided to taste all of them and pair them with the fresh bread provided. After all there was a Soup-er Bowl Challenge being held, in which guests got to vote on their favorite soup. Guest speakers Jummy Olabanji from ABC 7 and Wessita McKinley, Founder of Sistas United, spoke to the importance of nutrition and how so many families in the Nation\u2019s Capital go to bed hungry each day.All in all it was a great event for a great cause.", "source": "blog_posts", "title": "My Time at Empty Bowls", "doc_id": "blog_posts_500", "chunk_id": 0, "date": "October 11, 2014"}

No, it\u2019s not by drones\u2026yet. Quite simply, it is largely dependent on volunteers who help move the food in the CAFB\u2019s distribution center on a daily basis!At the CAFB, volunteerism is equally as important as monetary support. Volunteers are needed to get nutritious meals from the food bank\u2019s facilities into the homes of over 500,000 people. In the past year, the invaluable work of volunteers saved the CAFB $2.8 million in staffing costs.The need for volunteers, however, is still great.

Many local students returned healthy and prepared for the school year, thanks to the Capital Area Food Bank\u2019s child hunger programs. One such program, Family Markets, offers monthly market-style distributions of free fruits, vegetables, pasta, meat and other food items to children and families, providing up to 30 pounds of food primarily during the school year \u2013 with several regional distributions during the summer. Formerly the School Pantry Program, Family Markets are located directly on school grounds and allow families to shop for the food they want.Washington, D.C. has the second highest rate of child hunger in the nation, with one in three children at risk of hunger. In the Washington metro region, nearly 150,000 children struggle with hunger daily.

In the 1990s, when Kids Cafe was just a gleam in the food bank\u2019s eye, the dilemma centered on just how popular food bank leadership knew the program would be once it was launched. The food bank did not want to start a program that our clients would quickly come to depend on unless we knew we could keep it going and know that as it grew, we could sustain it.Capital One stepped in and for many years was the largest single financial supporter ofKids Cafe, annually providing grant funds of over $77,000 to provide the stability the program demanded. The program is now a secure neighborhood resource with a stable track record of service, serving over 2,600 children at 65 sites around the Washington metro region and has attracted many supporters. Capital One has continued to support child hunger programs at the CAFB, shifting its focus to Weekend Bag and now to Family Markets, a program modeled on a school pantry, but with a client-choice market flavor.With its innovative giving model and hands-on volunteer spirit, concentrating resources across community service programs and organizations in one neighborhood location, Capital One continues to earn the gratitude of the CAFB and many of its food assistance partners.Capital One generously supported the food bank\u2019s capital campaign and provides general operating funds through short term", "source": "blog_posts", "title": "Kids Come First at Capital One", "doc_id": "blog_posts_506", "chunk_id": 0, "date": "September 22, 2014"}

According to Share Our Strength, a nonprofit aiming to end childhood hunger, low-income families spend an average of $300 more per month on food during the summer months when kids are out of school. Nearly 200,000 children and teens are at risk of hunger in the Washington metro region; and 1 in 3 children in the District struggles to get enough food to eat.To respond to this need, the CAFB stepped up its support to children and families by participating in the summer meal program. In partnership with state agencies and with support from the USDA Summer Food Service Program, the food bank will host 23 summer meal sites in the District of Columbia, 24 in Northern Virginia and 27 in Maryland to feed more than 2,500 children daily.In addition to the summer meal program, the food bank participates in the Fresh Produce Grant, a farm program that connects 10 partner agencies with 4,000 pounds of high-quality produce from Claggett Farm and Waterpenny Farm.Community partners also help the CAFB address the summer meal gap.

Neighbors can greet each other while browsing fresh, local produce, baked goods, cheeses and other staples cultivated by regional farmers and local artisans. Throughout the Washington metro area, particularly in the District, farmer\u2019s markets are plentiful thanks to the increased demand for local produce by a booming population of food conscious consumers.The demand for produce spans all income brackets, yet the proliferation of farmer\u2019s markets does not mean increased access to fresh produce for all. For many low-income DC residents, the cost and accessibility of fresh produce is a deterrent that makes this dietary staple a fleeting luxury.To address this issue, the Capital Area Food Bank will launch its DC Community Marketplace on Saturday, June 7 at the 100 block of L Street, NW (between New Jersey Avenue and First Street, NW). The Marketplace will provide low-income families in the District with 30 pounds of monthly produce in a farmer\u2019s market setting.

What you may not realize is that the USDA has a similar program for seniors which the Capital Area Food Bank has been operating in DC for nearly two years.The Grocery Plus Program provides a monthly grocery supplement to low income seniors to help stretch their already taxed fixed incomes. Participants receive nearly thirty pounds of nutritious food which meets their specific dietary needs including healthy canned protein and dairy, whole grains, low sodium vegetables, and low added sugar fruit. The grocery mix encourages seniors to cook from scratch and many choose tomake the ingredients their own.Providing nutritious food to a food insecure senior population is critical. The adverse health effects of food insecurity are magnified for seniors. Food insecure seniors have significantly worse health outcomes than food secure seniors. They are 50% more likely to be diabetic, three times more likely to suffer from depression, and 60% more likely to have heart failure or experience a heart attack.The DC Grocery Plus Program is unique among jurisdictions in that it is administered in tandem with the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program, which provides participants with an annual fresh produce voucher to be redeemed at participating local farmers markets.

With a consistent uptick in food donations, he faced mounting challenges in moving food efficiently from elevated racks to the trucking docks. Last night, Mark got the sleeping pill he badly needed. No, it wasn\u2019t in the form of 18 different kinds of hors d\u2019oeuvres he devoured at Blue Jeans Ball. Rather, his restful slumber was attributed to the generous contributions provided by Blue Jeans Ball attendees so he may go and acquire additional double-deep reach trucks \u2014 essentially, an awesome fork lift. The 11th Annual Blue Jeans Ball grossed over $429,000, making it one of the most successful to date.

But persistence and patience paid off for drivers like Joseph Dunbar and David Maldonado (pictured here). It hadn\u2019t warmed up much at all by the time the second shift of drivers arrive at our Food Distribution Center \u2014 shortly before 6am. It is well known that hunger doesn\u2019t take a holiday. But it is easy to forget that hunger also doesn\u2019t stop for extreme weather. \u2026for some reason I can\u2019t stop thinking that we should quote Miley Cyrus: \u201cand we can\u2019t stop, and we won\u2019t stop!\u201d", "source": "blog_posts", "title": "5\u00b0 at 5am!

One in three children in Washington DC lives in a home where there simply is not enough food for them to eat. That means they go to bed hungry. They wake up hungry. They go to school hungry.The other is how there are still some people who just don\u2019t understand the face of hunger \u2014 who hunger really affects.You would think that with relentless economic uncertainty in the news, and the common knowledge that our economy has been taking a beating, that stereotypes would be broken. But the truth of the matter is, a lot of people think that if someone is hungry, it is because they are homeless, lazy or don\u2019t work hard enough. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.Those suffering from hunger today are working full-time jobs and yet still can\u2019t make ends meet because of frozen salaries, high rent, and entire families to feed.

But they all share one thing: they truly want better for their community.Some of the people I meet were fortunate enough to be born into families with strong political or business ties, and for many of them, their hard work is focused on continuing that family work.For others, their family history tells a different story.I have met many people who live in the DC region who share stories of hardship, and I\u2019ve seen many children growing up with only one parent in their lives. For these families, the struggle is real, and parents working two or more jobs just to feed their children is pretty much all they can focus on.That\u2019s why this Stuff-A-Truck event means so much to me. Obviously, the effort itself, and the partnership with the Capital Area Food Bank is important, and does a lot to help people in need.But getting to meet so many wonderful people is the part that touches me most.

For years, Wall Street brokers, Silicon Valley innovators, and celebrities have been paying nutritionists to advise them on antioxidants, balancing their protein consumption, free radicals and gut bacteria \u2014 all under the clear assumption that food matters to health and wellness. It does. Yet the obvious nature of this long-known fact has yet to fully pervade the conversation at the other end of the socio-economic spectrum, where too often the effort, the policies, and the systems are focused on providing quantities of food without paying attention to the critical link between food and health. The systems that support food access for poor communities \u2014 including federal programs, grocery chains, and even food banks \u2014 often wind up delivering inexpensive, mass-produced carbohydrates. This unfortunate phenomenon wasn\u2019t meant to disadvantage those with the least economic means.

{"text": "ByAmanda Melara\u2022November 4, 2013 In April 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), commonly known as the stimulus package, raised SNAP/food stamp benefits to help people affected by the recession. The increased benefits provided by this law expired on November 1, 2013.Because of this change SNAP/food stamp recipients can expect two changes in their benefit amounts during the fall of 2013. First, benefits may have increased slightly for households on October 1 due to a cost of living adjustment that happens every year at this time. However, on November 1 all families will see their benefits decrease due to the end of the extra benefits provided by ARRA.These changes affect all SNAP/food stamp recipients, but the actual change to benefits will vary from household to household. For example, a family of two could see their monthly benefits decrease by as much as $20 and a family of four by as much as $36.In our region, many are seeing cuts in their benefits: Cuts will affect those served by the Capital Area Food Bank, but the extent of the increase will not be known until after the cuts have taken place.

{"text": "ByBrian Lipinski\u2022September 25, 2013 An absolutely staggering amount of food is lost or wasted globally every year \u2013 about 1.3 billion metric tons, representing a third of the world\u2019s food by weight and a quarter of it by calorie. This loss and wastage leads to consequences for the environment, for your pocketbook, and for the hungry. And although this huge amount of waste suggests serious problems with the way our food is produced, transported, sold and consumed, it also means a lot can be done to save this food from the landfill. Food loss vs. food waste Generally, food loss refers to food that spoils or rots close to the farm. For example, a stockpile of corn might be eaten by pests, or a tomato could be squashed on its way to market. Food waste, on the other hand, occurs when someone makes a decision to throw away food that could have been eaten, like when a grocery store throws away unsold vegetables or when a household throws out a loaf of moldy bread. Food loss tends to be a bigger problem in places like Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where infrastructure isn\u2019t as developed, but in countries like the United States, the real problem is food waste. Almost 70% of all the calories lost and wasted in the US are thrown away at the retailer, restaurant or consumer level, which reveals a serious problem in the way we approach food.

How are these folks making it?As an outgrowth of this experience, I am excited to report that Montgomery County is taking action to help those who are living with food insecurity. On September 10, I will join with the County Council\u2019s Food Recovery Work Group, which I spearheaded, to announce an action plan to implement the first county-wide food recovery program in the nation.The Food Recovery Work Group includes representatives from the University of Maryland\u2019s Food Recovery Network, Manna Food Center, Share Our Strength, Montgomery College, the Department of Health and Human Services, private sector partners, and faith-based institutions who serve the hungry. This group was charged with evaluating the costs associated with creating a county-wide food recovery program and developing a strategic action plan for implementation. The Food Recovery Work Group also evaluated best practices; identified existing resources and ways to enhance communication among non-profit organizations, service providers, and food suppliers; and recommended needed policy changes to assist in these efforts.

{"text": "ByMary Cheh\u2022September 4, 2013 The District of Columbia has made significant strides in the effort to eliminate hunger. In the past three years, with the support of many of my colleagues on the DC Council, I have been able to pass legislation like the Healthy Schools Act of 2010, which requires schools to offer free breakfast to all students and the FEED DC Act, which establishes public/private partnerships to attract and renovate grocery stores in the District\u2019s low-income communities. Additionally, we successfully earmarked $200,000 in the 2014 budget to support the \u201cbonus bucks\u201d program, which allows those receiving SNAP, WIC, and those participating in the Senior Farmers\u2019 Market Nutrition Program to increase their buying power at farmers\u2019 markets, helping low-income families purchase more fresh fruits and vegetables.Although the District can be proud of these accomplishments, we cannot rest on our laurels. We must be vigilant in our work against the persistent ills of society, hunger among them. But the District cannot tackle this problem alone. We need federal programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps about 144,000 DC residents put food on the table for their families. Sadly, the 2009 Recovery Act\u2019s temporary boost to the SNAP benefits is scheduled to end on November 1, 2013 and renewal appears unlikely unless hunger advocates here and across the nation put increased pressure on Congress to provide the additional $5 billion needed to sustain the", "source": "blog_posts", "title": "DC Needs the Insight, Knowledge, Ideas, and Passion of Hunger Advocates", "doc_id": "blog_posts_612", "chunk_id": 0, "date": "September 4, 2013"}

Here is my response: It\u2019s basic \u2013 Hunger undermines our shared goals for a healthy, prosperous community.Take child hunger, for example. Child hunger is a health problem, an education problem and a workforce problem. Although child hunger is entirely preventable and unnecessary, one in five kids in the U.S. lives in food insecure households.What is even more unacceptable is that child hunger is an even greater problem in our nation\u2019s capital.

But my role as Board Chair is more than a personal commitment for me. It makes economic sense.Safeway is committed to being part of the solution for a hunger-free D.C. because it will make our region healthier and more prosperous.Here\u2019s what Safeway is doing to be part of the solution for hunger-free DC: This September for hunger action month, I invite Washington business leaders to join the conversation about hunger by sharing ideas about how Greater Washington can come together to solve hunger.", "source": "blog_posts", "title": "Washington Must Address Issue Undermining the Health and Prosperity of Its Citizens", "doc_id": "blog_posts_614", "chunk_id": 0, "date": "September 4, 2013"}

I met Father Eugene Brake at a going-away dinner for Lynn Brantley, the co-founder of Capital Area Food Bank in Washington, D.C. Father Brake is the other co-founder, and he began to tell me how it all began. As he talked, I was amazed to learn his story. Father Brake has devoted his life to feeding the poor and helping the homeless. And he did it his way.He\u2019s now 79, but decades ago he shunned church housing to live in dangerous inner city neighborhoods where he felt he could do the most good. He walked or biked, never owned a car. He never had a permanent residence, living from place to place. He devoted himself to feeding the poor. After all, Father Brake grew up in poverty in Wilmington, DE. He was one of 14 brothers and sisters living in a three-bedroom house.

The NSLP grew out of several aid programs put in place during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when agricultural products were begging for a market and children were going hungry. The program was designed to redistribute farm surpluses to hungry children.While school lunch needs \u2013 and is currently undergoing \u2013 a nutritional overhaul, the NSLP has become a cornerstone of national childhood nutrition. Over 65 years later, more than 31 million children across the nation eat school lunch every day.

I realized that there was a poverty issue in our country, but I never thought that families had to sacrifice going without food, especially healthy food. When hearing that one in six people and one in three children suffer from hunger in the Washington metro area, I immediately started to think about my friend\u2019s birthday party at The Cheesecake Factory two years ago. We could only eat half of our meals and wasted perfectly good food because the people in my small community take our three meals a day for granted, when just miles away, people are going to sleep with their stomachs empty. Hunger is an issue that people don\u2019t want to talk about, since in our great country, we want to stay in the dark about an issue that we know should be eradicated by now. Being a young adult who aspires to be a woman of action, I loved witnessing all of the results that came from the hard work at the CAFB. It was an incredible experience to be in an environment where everyone thoroughly enjoyed their work and the impact they made.

Roman is joined by Mike Curtin, CEO of DC Central Kitchen, and Pastor Michael Bell with Allen Chapel AME. We are facing an urban hunger crisis in the region. We know because we confront it here in urban Washington, DC and in some areas that surround us in Maryland and Northern Virginia. In the nation\u2019s capital, we have 31,000 children at risk of hunger \u2013 1 in 3. According to a recent Feeding America study, Washington, DC is second in the nation in child hunger, slightly behind New Mexico. We understand that solving hunger is intimately related to so many important social developments. If you are hungry, you cannot learn. If you are hungry, your immune system does not develop fully.

After the announcement of the intended shut down, many nearby stores sold out of bottled water, leaving little options for residents lacking adequate transportation, or for those who are home bound. People who could find water were faced with a large, unplanned expense. Purchasing bottled water for drinking is, in and of itself, expensive. Purchasing bottled water for five days\u2019 worth of hygiene, cooking and drinking is a significant expense for most of the country, let alone for the 15% of Prince George\u2019s County residents who are considered food insecure.By every right, this emergency could have become a crisis.

Both potent symbols for food growing, the Victory Garden and Kitchen Garden exemplify how gardens can supplement one\u2019s food supply while supporting healthy food choices.From the White House to our house, food growing has never been easier in and around our nation\u2019s capital.The Capital Area Food Bank provides training for its broad network of partner agencies to start gardens and educate clients about gardening and food growing. This spring, two exciting gardening workshops will be offered: You can\u2019t teach about gardening without getting your hands dirty. The food bank\u2019sUrban Demonstration Gardenwill serve as the outdoor learning laboratory for its food growing workshops. Partners will contribute to the growth of the garden and find inspiration in the innovative food growing techniques being demonstrated.Keep checking the CAFB blog for updates on the building of the Capital Area Food Bank\u2019sUrban Demonstration Gardenand learn how toget involved.Abbie Steiner is the Capital Area Food Bank\u2019s Resident Food Growing Expert.

The brown rice provides a filling whole grain, the corn and tomato offers a good serving of nutritious vegetables and the canned chicken and peanut sauce provide a protein punch. No rice on hand? Switch the grain in this dish out for others that may be sitting in the cupboard. Try this with noodles! Repurpose ingredients in this recipe for other meals. Corn is great for soups, salads and casseroles. Canned tomatoes make great sauce, salsa, or soup. Brown rice is a great addition to soup, meatballs, or stir fry.

From our garden to yours, here are three tips to ensure your garden \u201csprings forward.\u201dStart with the soil. First time gardener? Seasoned veteran? Success means starting with the basics. Healthy soil, easy drainage and access to water increase your ability to create a thriving garden. When growing in any space,test for soil qualityand if you aregrowing in containers, replace your soil every season so plants have access to essential nutrients.Make your bed(s). After lying dormant for the winter season, garden beds require spring cleaning. To prepare your beds, turn under any growth from the previous season. Adding organic matter to enrich the soil is the last step in creating garden beds that will thrive all season. The best source for organic matter isCOMPOST! Compost adds nutrient-rich humus to fuel plant growth and restore vitality to depleted soil.Plan for Plants. Choose what you want to grow. Some plants should be planted from seed and others from transplants.

Some people can\u2019t cook these seasonal delights because they\u2019re too busy making sure they have food in the first place. And often times these are families with children.School meals are a vital resource to our children, especially those at risk of hunger.

Many families depend on this resource as it helps offset the costs of raising children.But what happens when school is out for the summer?

Withlooming federal budget cutsand a recovering economy, nonprofits have to find ways to clearly communicate their value to donors. Unlike for-profit companies, nonprofits cannot simply speak to their success through the \u201cbottom line.\u201d At nonprofits like the Capital Area Food Bank, we have to tell our story through a different lens.Some nonprofits fail because they are unable to effectively communicate the results of their work. After graduating from college, I took a job as a social worker connecting low-income families to community resources like food pantries and temporary housing. Building close relationships with clients was time consuming, but I found it to be the most critical element to my success. Unfortunately, it is not easy to quantify the value of relationship building and shortly after I began my work, the program lost funding.In the failure of the program, I saw opportunity. I went to graduate school and learned how nonprofits can clearly capture and communicate the vital impact they are making in the community on a daily basis.This personal investment in impact measurement led me to the Capital Area Food Bank: a nonprofit explicitly dedicated to measuring its community impact.

Right here, in the shadow of the nation\u2019s capital, one in two children goes to bed hungry and looks forward to going to school, not to learn, but to eat the school meals provided. Seniors are forced to decide between paying for medicine and buying groceries.To help shine a light on the issue of hunger in America, Directors Kristi Jacobson and Lori Silverbush created the documentaryA Place at the Table, which examines the issue through the lens of three people who are struggling with hunger. The documentary will debut in theatres, on demand and itunes premiering Friday, March 1. It will be shown in DC atLandmark\u2019s E Street Cinemaat 555 11th St. NW. Show times are 1:00 pm, 3:15 pm, 5:30 pm, 7:45 pm and 10:00 pm.The documentary explores the issues that the Capital Area Food Bank and its partner agencies experience daily. Ultimately, the film shows us how hunger poses serious economic, social and cultural implications for our nation, and that we all can work together to ensure that healthy food is affordable and available to everyone.So, if you\u2019re looking for something to do Friday night, check out A Place at the Table and see how hunger impacts us all.", "source": "blog_posts", "title": "One Nation\u2026Underfed", "doc_id": "blog_posts_694", "chunk_id": 0, "date": "February 28, 2013"}

Whether tackling hunger or clean water, disease eradication, literacy, or social justice, solutions to the great humanitarian and social problems of our day have eluded us.

But as days become months and months become years, these stubborn social problems have outlasted our commitment, our resources, and sometimes even our compassion. So we ask: Given that these problems are overwhelming and persistent, might not we fight them more effectively in partnership rather than alone? If that\u2019s the case, how can we maximize impact through collaboration? And how should we think about these critical relationships? At WFP, it became abundantly clear that our work, once deemed the purview of \u201cdonor governments,\u201d required a broader set of players. Back then, I was focused on engaging the private sector, in particular, to join with government and civil society to more effectively reach hungry people around the world. During my five years with the UN, our unconventional thinking about public-private partnerships became conventional wisdom, as governments began to embrace the idea that they, too, needed partners \u2014 not just for additional funding but for the expertise that private-sector partners often are uniquely positioned to provide.

Today the CAFB reaches nearly 500,000 men, women and children in the Washington metro area each year who are at risk of hunger.In the early days, the food bank was a small operation providing 1,537 pounds of food per month to a few thousand people. Today, the CAFB has 130 employees and distributes 33 million pounds of food a year \u2013 half of which is fresh produce \u2013 through 700 non-profit partner agencies located in Washington, DC; Northern Virginia; and Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery counties in Maryland.Due to the uncertain economy and the increasing numbers of those suffering from inadequate nutrition, the Capital Area Food Bank embarked on a capital campaign five years ago and moved into its new headquarters at 4900 Puerto Rico Avenue, NE in late July.

House of Representatives voted on January 1st to pass the American Tax Relief Act of 2012 by a vote of 257-167; following the Senate\u2019s passage of the same bill the day before. The passage of this act allows for a one-year extension of the current Food, Conservation & Energy Act of 2008, known as the Farm Bill. This legislation is not set to expire until the end of fiscal year 2013 in September.For Americans and food banks across the nation the passage of the American Tax Relief is good news. However, there is much work still to be done to ensure that our nation\u2019s entitlement programs do not disappear or receive major cuts at the end of FY 2013.Congressional Republicans are moving forward to support cuts to programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Prior to the recent passage of the American Tax Relief Act, the U.S. Senate approved SNAP cuts of $4 Billion and the House called for cuts of $16 Billion.
