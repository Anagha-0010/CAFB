Obesity, often linked to poor quality diet, affects 40% of adults and 20% of children nationally.1 More and more peer-reviewed research supports the fact that diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension are all directly related to poor nutrition.2 Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death for adults in the US.

By working with hospitals and other clinical settings, our newest program models are making nutritious food accessible directly at the point of care for those in need through \u201cFood Is Medicine\u201d approaches. What is food is medicine? Food is Medicine (FIM) refers to a spectrum of programs and services that respond to the critical link between nutrition and chronic illness. These approaches recognize healthy food as an important part of patient medical care and treatment. Interventions can take a variety of forms including medically tailored groceries, produce \u201cprescriptions\u201d, and medically tailored meals. Significant research supports food is medicine program models Research continues to show that nutritious food, when incorporated into medical care, can help to improve health. For instance, Veggie Rx\u2014a healthy food incentive program\u2014provides participants who are low-income and hypertensive, obese, and/or diabetic with produce prescription coupons along with their standard medical interventions.

Food-insecure adults in the study showed improvements in all categories of their healthy eating index score, including decreases in solid fats, alcohol, and added sugar. Food-insecure and hypoglycemic participants also reported lower food-insecurity rates, lower rates of hypoglycemia, and fewer days where mental health interfered with their quality of life.11 Food is medicine at the Capital Area Food Bank Under its \u201cFood Plus Health\u201d model, the food bank is executing several pilot programs focused on coupling healthy food with healthcare services.

Food insecurity during pregnancy and early childhood can lead to birth defects, low birth weight, preterm birth, gestational diabetes, and developmental risks.12 Pregnant women with compromised nutrition are at greater risk of having shorter pregnancies and babies 12 Hartline-Grafton, H.

For the food bank\u2019s food pharmacy model, this would entail developing a centralized food pharmacy and resource hub within a hospital, serving all its departments. Patients who screen positive for food insecurity as a part of their intake process would go to this location to meet with an on-site nutritionist, who would be trained to help visitors select foods to take home that meet their specific medical concerns. The food pharmacy would also serve as an information center, helping to guide patients towards other resources they may need (assistance with accessing SNAP, WIC, federal housing assistance, and other services). Patients would also have access to the food pharmacy and resource hub outside of their medical appointments, and could seek assistance between hospital visits as needed. Long-term efforts include creating a centralized food pharmacy and resource hub within a hospital, providing patients across all departments with medically tailored food as well as informational resources. 9 Food Is Medicine at the Capital Area Food Bank As in other pilots, the CAFB would use the expertise of a third-party research institute to inform the design, evaluation, and data analysis of this research endeavor.

Accordingly, the CAFB is pursuing policy changes alongside its programmatic work that will embed nutrition services into healthcare delivery and financing systems, enabling insurers, providers, and organizations like the CAFB to contribute to healthier outcomes for those we serve.

{"text": "Food insecurity in Maryland Hunger affects individuals the world over, on every continent and in every country. The capital region of the United States is no exception. Nearly 1.5 million people in our area experienced some level of food insecurity last year, meaning they weren\u2019t always sure where their next meal would come from. In CAFB\u2019s Maryland service region, which includes Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties, 41% of our neighbors are facing the difficult reality of food insecurity. Hunger\u2019s impacts are far-reaching. Children have a more difficult time learning. Adults struggle to concentrate. People of every age face higher rates of diet-related disease. Those impacts ultimately affect the health of our communities, and the vibrancy of our workforce and our local economies. In short, when people in our region don\u2019t have the food they need, it impacts all of us. How the Capital Area Food Bank makes a difference for our neighbors The Capital Area Food Bank\u2019s mission is to help our neighbors thrive by creating equitable access to food and opportunity through community partnerships. Since 1980, we\u2019ve been the backbone of the hunger relief infrastructure in the greater Washington region. Each year, we supply the food for nearly 60 million meals to a network of hundreds of nonprofit organizations across Maryland, Virginia, and DC.
