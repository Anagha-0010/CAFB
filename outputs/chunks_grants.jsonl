January 11, 2016 Dear , Thank you for your invitation to submit this Letter of Inquiry on behalf of The Museum of Flight. has been the Museum's valuable partner in our restoration activities going back to 1983, when personal project, a Curtiss JN-4D Jenny, became the first aircraft exhibited in the Museum's newly restored Boeing Red Barn, the first building on The Museum of Flight's campus. In 2011, assisted the Museum in upgrading the Curtiss Jenny exhibit in the J. Elroy McCaw Personal Courage Wing, and in 2013, provided us with a challenge grant for the successful refurbishment of our SPAD S.XIII (S.13). We are very grateful for your partnership in our efforts throughout the years to bring aviation history back to life in such an enriching manner. I'm reaching out now to invite the to assist The Museum of Flight with a very important capital improvement project, one that will impact every major aircraft restoration project the Museum embarks on in the future. The buildings housing the Museum's Restoration Center and Reserve Collection (RCRC) are in need of renovations to improve the safety and effectiveness of the working environment and increase energy efficiency. The RCRC is located at Paine Field in Everett, Washington- 32 miles north of the Museum's main campus at Boeing Field - and comprised of two hangars: C-72 & C-73", "source": "collateral", "title": "2017_Museum_of_Flight.pdf", "doc_id": "grant_proposals_000", "chunk_id": 0, "date": "2017-03-24"}

The Museum\u2019s vision is to be the foremost educational air and space museum in the world. BRIEF HISTORY: In 1965, a small group of aviation enthusiasts established the Pacific Northwest Aviation Historical Foundation (PNAHF) with the goals of saving significant aircraft and related artifacts, and educating the public about their importance. When the Port of Seattle leased land to the PNAHF in 1975, a permanent home was established that would house The Red Barn \u00ae, the birthplace of The Boeing Company. As the Museum collection grew, new galleries, collections storage, visitor services and administrative office space were built to enhance the Museum\u2019s ability to care for the collection and use it to educate and inspire visitors. In the summer of 2016, a new 140,000 square foot Aviation Pavilion will open to the public nearly doubling the Museum\u2019s protected exhibit and education space. The Pavilion will cover 18 of the Museum\u2019s large and most iconic aircraft such as the first Boeing 747, 727 and 737 which recently made its final flight from the RCRC to the Museum\u2019s main campus. Today, the Museum is one of the largest air and space museums in the world, attracting more than 525,000 visitors in 2015 to enjoy exhibits and participate in educational and public programs, and group events.

The Museum continues to deliver on its vision by expanding our role as a leader in the delivery of informal science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education programs in Washington State. Museum staff impacted nearly 160,000 pre-K-12 students and teachers in 2015 through 2,040 onsite and outreach education programs. Our goal is to increase this number to 220,000 annually by 2020. Gender, ethnicity and income level are all factors that can discourage a young person from pursuing a college education, especially in science, technology and engineering fields. The Museum\u2019s goal is to serve at least 50% of our annual youth education participants from these underrepresented populations.

Because colonoscopy is the gold-standard and because of concern about cultural norms related to toileting, TACH medical providers have historically opted not to promote stoolbased screening. However, with the recent hiring of several new medical providers and a new Medical Director, TACH is exploring how best to shift to stool-based screening. The proposed AxCS project allows TACH to benefit from CVHS\u2019s experience and UVACC\u2019s expertise. Table 4.

Changes in cancer screening, including UDS data, and changes in referral for care and treatment in the service area between 2019 and 2021 that may be attributed to the COVID19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic put a strain on community health center services throughout Virginia and the US. The pandemic impacted mammograms and the ability to get patients their mammograms while at the clinic, since clinicians often focused on vaccination instead. Also, there has been a requirement to delayed mammograms to 6 weeks post COVID-vaccine to get into to be screened. As Table 8 below shows, at CVHS the CRC screening rate dropped 4% from 2019 to 2021, and the breast cancer screening rate dropped 4%, as of 2021. At TACH CRC screening rate has dropped gradually, from 45.9 in 2019, to 44.9 in 2020, to 41% in 2021. The breast cancer screening rate at TACH dropped 3% as of 2021. Table 8.

Most sites remain short-staffed, which combined with the impact of COVID-19 exposures, further strains CVHS resources. Cancer screening, along with other preventive services, suffered due to these COVID-related workforce impacts. TACH also saw a decrease in patient volume during 2020, but it increased in 2021. TACH did not experience the same workforce shortages as CVHS, but the COVID protocols put in place to protect patients and staff led to a reprioritization of efforts and many patients were seen by telehealth instead of in person, and screening that would have taken place in person was skipped in many telehealth appointments.

Mobile Mammography: Accessing mammography is a top need to for breast cancer screening because of the geographic location of services and insufficient transportation to screening sites. Although CVHS has a mammography unit at its Buckingham clinic, women from other CVHS sites must travel up to two hours to be screened there. TACH does not have a mammography unit, so must refer all women off-site for screening. The closest sites to TACH for mammograms are through Ballad Health and Carilion, located over an hour away for most TACH patients. Given the distance to screening mammography, UVACC proposes to establish routine visits from the UVA Mobile Prevention Coach. The mobile coach will bring comprehensive breast screening closer to home for women seen at the rural clinics. The self-contained coach uses the latest technology, including 3D imaging.

Despite this positive change for one group of patients, there remains a barrier for patients who are on traditional Medicaid and Medicare plans or are uninsured. They are left with significant costs associated with colonoscopy. There are similar financial barriers for CHC patients related to breast cancer screening. These costs often deter patients from completing their screening, leaving some of the most vulnerable patients at greatest risk of late-stage diagnosis for breast and colorectal cancer.

Past efforts of the two Health Centers, alone or in collaboration with other partners, to increase the number and percentage of patients accessing cancer screening and referral for care and treatment. Currently CVHS is a partner under Project Coalesce, a two-year cancer education and awareness grant-funded project initiated by the VCU Massey Cancer Center. Massey is the other NCI-designated cancer center in Virginia. The project is focused on increasing cancer screenings to tackle the very high cancer incidence in southside Virginia, by raising public awareness and developing health education events, while engaging with community partners to execute activities. CVHS project is focused on its rural Brunswick County clinic, in partnership with Brunswick Health Ambassadors (BHA), a community group. In addition to CVHS, three other CHCs that serve different service areas (Richmond and southern Virginia) are partnering with VCU Massey CC under Project Coalesce. Through Project Coalesce, during 2021 and 2022 CVHS and BHA have participated in health fairs; organized an event for men to raise awareness about CRC and encourage screening, planned an education event for women to be held fall 2022 (focused on breast and cervical cancer), and are contributing a bi-weekly column on health for the local Brunswick newspaper.

As neighboring health centers, the organizations work to complement services. The CEOs of both Health Centers are in regular contact, on an almost weekly basis, consulting with each other, answering questions, and providing suggestions for resources. Also, senior leadership team members from each consult with their counterparts. For example, CVHS has the strongest pharmacy program in Virginia and the CVHS Pharmacy Director consults with the TACH Pharmacy Director. Similarly, TACH has a very mature BH program. The CEO of TACH is a psychologist. Consequently, various CVHS staff have reached out to TACH regarding BH questions.

Over half of CVHS sites are in rural, medically underserved communities; the rest serve urban areas with low poverty populations. In 2021 CVHS served over 48,000 patients. The focus of this Rural Communities Collaborative cancer screening project is breast and colorectal cancer (CRC). CVHS and its neighboring community health center, Tri Area Community Health (TACH), will work closely with the University of Virginia Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2019s Office of Community Outreach and Engagement to execute the project workplan. The goal is to increase screenings for breast and colorectal cancer and follow up across the combined 27 counties and 2 cities served by CVHS and TACH.

Comprehensive primary medical and BH services are provided at all sites except one, where BH is provided to complement medical care offered by the existing rural health clinic and free clinic. TACH\u2019s service area is in the economically depressed Appalachian region, with the median household income almost $30,000 lower than the Virginia median. TACH served over 10,000 patients in 2021. Each of the communities served by the two Health Centers has unique characteristics, with clinics developed, over time, to meet the needs of people living in that region. Accessible primary care for all populations, especially for the medically underserved, is the goal. In rural communities, lack of primary care providers, distance, low health literacy, and poverty are major barriers to care, in addition to other social factors that may negatively impact health outcomes. Urban residents more frequently face poverty, linguistic challenges, poor educational achievement, or cultural barriers. Common themes include lack of insurance, health disparities, and the need for affordable care for prevention of diseases, including cancer. The proposed project will address the needs of the targeted population at each of the thirteen project sites over a two-year period.

Over the years, our community partnerships have grown stronger as more residents know we are here to help address the homeless animal population. In 2012, we launched our spay/neuter program and formalized community outreach efforts the following year. As a result, the community saw a radical decline in the number of stray animals. Since then, animal intake at our local animal control has massively decreased.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: What progress has your organization made to increase its diversity, equity, and inclusion in the past two to three years? What are its plans for the next two to three years? In 2019, GPG changed its adoption and foster application process to be much more inclusive, welcoming and impartial. Historically, we required home inspections of adopters and fosters, as well as questions regarding employment and other invasive topics not indicative of someone\u2019s ability to take care of a pet in need. This approach was and is still standard practice for many animal shelters and rescues today. During her time as Program Director, Alisha Vianello, who is now GPG\u2019s Executive Director was hired to manage the adoption and foster programs. While overseeing these programs, Alisha removed the requirement for home visits and reference checks, as well as implemented a condensed, neutral adoption and foster request form that focuses on basic information for pet matchmaking purposes versus screening applicants. Along with these improvements, Alisha focused on educating current volunteers and staff on eliminating bias in the adoption and foster process. Aside from a few naysayers who opposed the change and made the decision to leave, this new approach has been embraced with open arms by our compassionate and caring supporters.

Intake, foster and adoption There will always be dogs and cats that need homes. In 2021, we took in 1,139 pets from our service area - 456 cats/kittens and 410 dogs/puppies. This was a 30 percent increase from 2020 and 100 percent increase from 2019. On average, it costs $250 to provide basic intake vetting for a healthy dog. A third of the adult dogs we see are heartworm positive, which quickly over doubles the vetting costs. Cats and dogs arrive through several avenues such as local animal control or owner surrender. If it comes through local animal control or as a stray, we will make every attempt to \ufb01nd the owner. Every animal goes through intake vetting, which includes vaccinations and wellness exams. For kittens and puppies, we place them directly into foster care. With adults, they go through intake until they are placed in foster or on the adoption", "source": "collateral", "title": "Gateway_Pet_Guardians_Final_Proposal_2023.pdf", "doc_id": "grant_proposals_002", "chunk_id": 12, "date": ""}

How did you shift to address the challenge? Clinic: Since opening in 2020, one of the lessons learned is that a traditional veterinary clinic set up is not necessarily conducive to our community needs. During its \ufb01rst year, the clinic operated primarily by appointment, booking a month in advance with a majority not showing up. This approach failed as many of our clients live paycheck-to-paycheck so they hold off planning and seeking care. This past November, we switched to a \ufb01rst come, \ufb01rst serve walk-in model, which has been well-received and increased ef\ufb01ciency and volume of pets receiving care. With the pandemic, many things came to a halt, including providing vaccinations. To provide vaccinations safely, we changed our monthly format to a drive up system. Our drive-thru clinics have been so successful that we adopted the system permanently for our monthly vaccination clinics. Staff Retention: Animal welfare positions tend to have very low wages with high rates of turnover due to burnout from limited support and the emotional nature of this industry.

(4000 character max) HHOC aims to achieve its vision of access to health for all by reducing costs for families in medical crisis, improving health outcomes through shorter hospital stays, and providing proximity to world-class healthcare that is more necessity than convenience. The high costs of ongoing medical treatment negatively impact patient health. For example, families facing cancer make up the majority of HHOC\u2019s guests each year, and 45% of cancer patients with medical debt delayed or avoided medical care for serious issues (American Cancer Society, 2022). Considering the nightly rates of local hotels, HHOC offset nearly $2 million in lodging costs for patients and caregivers last year, alleviating some of the financial burdens associated with ongoing medical care. Based on trends in the average length of stay for its guests, HHOC anticipates offsetting an average of approximately $1000 in lodging costs per family. Shorter hospital stays reduce medical fees, lower mortality rates and risks of infection, and improve treatment outcomes (National Library of Medicine, 2019). HHOC aims to be a resource to patients who need to remain close to their care but are medically stable enough to stay outside of the hospital.

Broward Boulevard Fort Lauderdale, FL 33312 GRANT AMOUNT REQUESTED: $________ PROGRAM: Early Education Program 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Our mission is to strengthen children and families through innovative education, supportive programming, and community engagement. Jack & Jill Center is the oldest nonprofit provider of early childhood education in Broward County. It was established in 1942 by the Junior League of Greater Fort Lauderdale, originally to provide childcare for women entering the workforce as their husbands fought in World War II. Today, 80 years later, Jack & Jill Center is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) community-based organization that provides comprehensive, holistic, wraparound support services to children of high-need parents who work or attend school in order to improve their well-being and quality of life. To date, Jack & Jill Center has served nearly 20,000 children and families. Our Early Education Program provides quality, year-round early childhood education focusing on enabling children to grow emotionally, physically, and socially in a safe, caring environment using age-appropriate methods for cognitive growth. Jack & Jill Center is one of only two NAEYC (National Association for the Education of Young Children) accredited centers in Fort Lauderdale.

We invite you to partner with us as we continue in our mission to serve disadvantaged children and families in Broward County. THE VALUE OF INVESTING IN EARLY LEARNING Extensive research confirms that preschool plays a pivotal role in the academic success of underserved children. In low-income communities, the scarcity of quality early childhood education poses a significant challenge, as many children enter kindergarten ill-equipped to compete with their more privileged peers. They face a deficit in language and social skills right from the start, creating an uphill battle \u2013 a cycle that often remains unbroken due to the lack of guidance for their parents. However, by providing high-quality early childhood education, we can empower all children to start on equal footing and achieve lasting success. Numerous studies consistently demonstrate the numerous benefits of early school enrollment, such as lifelong academic accomplishments, increased graduation rates, reduced delinquency rates, and a decreased need for special education services. Renowned economist James Heckman emphasizes that community investing in quality preschool programs yields a remarkable 7-10% return per year over a child's lifetime. The Perry Preschool Study stands as a comprehensive testament to the long-term", "source": "collateral", "title": "Jack_and_Jill_Center_Final_Proposal_2023.pdf", "doc_id": "grant_proposals_004", "chunk_id": 1, "date": "2023-08-18"}
{"text": " impacts of early education, as it evaluated individuals at the age of 40. Remarkably, the study's findings reveal that those who had the opportunity to attend preschool programs experienced higher earnings, exhibited greater employment rates, demonstrated a reduced likelihood of engaging in criminal activities, and were more likely to have successfully graduated from high school compared to their peers who lacked access to preschool education. 3 Furthermore, a noteworthy 2004 study conducted by the Economic Policy Institute highlights the substantial returns that taxpayers can expect from investing in quality child care and education. For every dollar invested, taxpayers can recoup more than $2.50, while simultaneously benefiting the families involved. STATEMENT OF NEED The data from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey reveals a sobering reality: in Broward County, a staggering 255,000 individuals currently live below the federal poverty line. Out of the total of 694,980 households in Broward County, an alarming 50% find themselves residing at or below the Asset Limited, Income Constrained Employed (ALICE) threshold, as outlined in the United Way's 2020 ALICE Report update. Within this context, it is crucial to recognize the unique circumstances faced by the families at Jack & Jill Center. The center primarily serves single working mothers, who, despite their determination and effort, find themselves within 175% of the poverty level, with a median income of $28,500.

{"text": ", a challenging feat when juxtaposed with the stark contrast of the annual Household Survival Budget of $69,516, an amount necessary for an average Florida family of four to make ends meet (ALICE Report 2020). It is worth highlighting that a significant number of our families hail from three specific zip codes: 33311, 33312, and 33313. Regrettably, these areas have long grappled with elevated poverty rates, instances of abuse and neglect, accidental deaths, and a persistent cycle of intergenerational poverty. The burdensome struggle of securing reliable and affordable child care creates an inescapable cycle of poverty that persists across generations. The absence of stable child care often compels parents to discontinue their education or job training, leading to frequent absences from work and high turnover rates. Consequently, parents face significant obstacles in attaining steady incomes, career progression, and overall stability for themselves and their children. Moreover, poverty can hinder a child's capacity to learn and contribute to a range of social, emotional, and behavioral issues, as well as adverse health and mental health outcomes. Extensive research has consistently highlighted the transformative impact of high-quality early childhood education on children's development. Such education equips them with the readiness needed to excel academically, increases the likelihood of completing high school and pursuing higher education, reduces incarceration rates, and enhances future earning potential.

{"text": ". This award-winning, research-based curriculum is widely regarded as a forward-thinking, comprehensive, and culturally rich approach that respects the role that teachers play in making learning relevant for every child. Activities are designed to meet specific goals for social, physical, cognitive, and language development. As a result, children become more social: forming friendships, playing in groups, and learning to get along and share with others. Creative Play Jack & Jill Center\u2019s Early Education Program is deeply rooted in the philosophy that children learn through play. We structure our classroom environments to offer dynamic spaces to engage children\u2019s imaginations. The Creative Curriculum allows children to unlock more creativity through activities such as socio-dramatic play, open-ended art activities, free-choice activities, using manipulatives and puzzles. For example, Unit Blocks are effective tools for children to become the architects of their space, learn the basic mathematic principles of shape, proportion, physics and support, use symmetry, patterns and geometry, as well as practice cooperation, persistence and self-control. These versatile wooden structures become the building blocks for higher test scores in math and science, planning and problem solving, character development, creative socio-dramatic play, and motor coordination. Research shows that for every 15 minutes of free play, 4- and 5-year-olds spend a third of their time engaged in spatial, mathematical, and architectural activities.

Continuity of care is the high-quality practice of having teachers and children stay together for several years, rather than having children change teachers and groups of peers each year, or more frequently. Because learning occurs simultaneously with emotional attachment, it is best for young children to have a stable caregiver throughout their early years. Children and their teachers are moved up as a group into the next classroom one time a year. This practice fosters strong attachment and benefits the children by giving them caregivers who know them and their parents well. Family-teacher relationships are strengthened as well, as parents and teachers also have more time to get to know and trust one another. Within this relationship, parents are more likely to share concerns about their child, listen to the teacher\u2019s suggestions, and learn from observing teacher-child interactions. Finally, this approach allows teachers to develop and put into practice a broader understanding of child development as they observe it first-hand over a longer period of time than in most child care settings. Anecdotal evidence suggests that teachers experience greater emotional satisfaction from the longer relationships with children and families, which may in turn lead to increased job retention \u2013 a critical goal in the field of early care and education.

These infrastructure enhancements will also open up growing space for KNOX farming participants. The three-level KNOX Urban Farming Program supports a phased path on an independent farming career. Goals for farming participants can include an entrepreneurial path towards a farm business, a part-time project selling value-added products, or employment as farmers for an established agricultural business.

However, lit- tle is known about the effectiveness of the reentry programs for young people and recidivism rates for juvenile justice continue to be as high as 75%.2 In 2015, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, (OJJDP) Office of Justice Programs, US Department of Justice, launched two juvenile justice data improvement programs to identify reentry and best practice data to better understand what helps young people succeed after system involvement. The Initia- tive to Develop Juvenile Reentry Measurement Standards (RS) project was awarded to the Per- formance-based Standards Learning Institute, Inc.

In 2018, OJJDP launched a subsequent data improvement project to further that work: Improving Juvenile Reentry Programs\u2019 Capacity for Reentry Data Collection, Analysis and Reporting.

Develop, pilot test and implement a mobile application with reentry resources for youth One of the lessons learned working with the first cohort of reentry data capacity-building sites was the need to put community resources directly into the hands of young people. Agencies offered services and financial support, yet young people either weren\u2019t aware of them, didn\u2019t want continued connection to the justice system or simply did not know how to access or use the assistance. To put resources directly into the hands of the young people, the PbS team proposes to build a mobile application with the belief using technology to link young people to services, supporters and opportunities would help many young people understand what they need and where they can get help to avoid subsequent offending. This reentry application (reentry app) PbS Learning Institute Page 18 will turn OJJDP\u2019s \u201cReentry Starts Here: A Guide for Youth in Long-Term Juvenile Corrections or Treatment Programs\u201d toolkit8 into a resource available on a young person\u2019s mobile phone.

The Episcopal Health Foundation found that 49% of Texas families report that the pandemic has caused financial hardship for them, including 16% who said it caused severe financial suffering. The study found that", "source": "collateral", "title": "The_Capital_Good_Fund_Final_Proposal_2023.pdf", "doc_id": "grant_proposals_008", "chunk_id": 2, "date": "2023-08-10"}
{"text": " BIPOC families were more likely to report financial hardship, including 59% of Hispanic/Latinx and 45% African-American/Black households in Texas, compared to 42% of white households. Hispanic/Latinx families born outside of the United States were the hardest hit, with over 71% reporting financial hardship. These alarming statistics demonstrate that economically vulnerable Texas families, including BIPOC families, female-headed households, and immigrants, need access to capital to smooth over temporary cash-flow issues and address pressing needs, yet the inability to secure equitable credit has left them with few options; often, they turn to high-interest debt such as payday loans, which carry over a 600% APR in Texas. Our Crisis Relief Loan program is an equitable solution that provides transparent, credit-building capital liquidity to families who have been historically shut out of financial opportunity because of generations of systemic racism to cover critical expenses, address the lingering impacts of COVID-19, and enter the financial mainstream. The Crisis Relief Loan In early April 2020, we launched the Crisis Relief Loan (\u201cCRL\u201d) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Crisis Relief Loans range from $300 - $1,500 at just 5% APR (fixed) and feature a 15-month term, the first three of which are a deferment period.

In short, between earned income and philanthropic support, we are able to both sustain and grow the Crisis Relief Loan. Previous Funding Last year, Capital Good Fund received a $60,000 grant from Foundation to support our Crisis Relief Loan program in Texas. Within just three months of receiving the generous funding, we met our proposed goals and financed 120 Crisis Relief Loans to low- to moderate-income Texas families. Since the average household size to which we lend consists of 3 people, we estimate that we reached 360 individuals with the previous grant. We anticipate easily meeting or exceeding our goals once again with this funding. Conclusion We envision an inclusive Texas in which all families, especially historically marginalized communities, have access to safe, affordable, and transparent credit that enables them to weather significant financial shocks caused by the pandemic and quickly recover from them.

SVHC distinguishes itself from other agencies serving at-risk youth by providing behavioral health services as a key element of its program. The agency\u2019s location in the municipality of Normandy, centered in North St. Louis County, is essential in addressing the needs of at-risk youth in these distressed communities characterized by low-performing or unaccredited schools, and with significant economic and social challenges. SVHC engages in cross referrals with 2 local agencies that are similar in mission and provide shelter services and programs targeting at- risk youth: . Although and focus on homeless youth, neither addresses mental health issues relative to aftercare. Other local organizations provide case management and referral, but do not offer the intensive clinical treatment that is available through SVHC, inclusive at one site. Through linkage between key strategic partners offering complementary services, SVHC is also connecting youth to critical specialized supports such as substance use disorder counseling, human trafficking and sexual assault programs, and extended shelter and housing interventions.

As such, SVHC has historically adapted its programs to seamlessly meet community needs due to support provided and contributed by an array of private, local, state, county, federal, and pass-through funding sources. However, as the crime rate and poverty continue to dramatically rise in the already distressed service area, exacerbated by the devastating effects of COVID-19 on the local economy, inflation, and unemployment, there is a corresponding sharp increase in the number of homeless youth requesting services, and a reported decrease in individual donations and private foundation funding to support crisis services. As a result of these rapidly changing circumstances, and also due to the increase in need and strain on local resources, SVHC has needed to adjust services and modify interventions including increasing technology-based support for homeless and runaway youth who often do not have consistent forms of communication and is seeking RHY and additional expanded sources of support to supplement and expand outreach efforts. Therefore, if SVHC does not receive RHY funding, the most devastated and impoverished sector of the St. Louis Metropolitan Area, which is North County, will continue to see a rise of youth living on the streets, which would undoubtedly add trafficking, violence, and substance use disorder to the factors of existing high-crime, lower- income, and disparities in access to services.

Limited access to health care affects tens of millions of Americans daily. Most of the affected populations are identified as transportation disadvantaged, meaning persons who are unable to transport themselves or purchase transportation due to physical or mental disability, income status, or age. Unmet health-related needs for these vulnerable populations include lack of transportation to and from health education, mental health and substance abuse programs, dialysis centers, follow-up visits, medical testing, and other health care services. Mobile health clinics can play an important part and reduce health disparities, especially among vulnerable populations, those with chronic illness, and rural communities without easy access to healthcare facilities. For some people, mobile health clinics are the only means to lifesaving medical treatment. For many, access to affordable health care may not be possible without mobile clinic services.

But mobile health clinics are changing that, driving better patient access to care by pulling right into a patient\u2019s neighborhood.

The average operational cost of these clinics is $429,000 annually. And with 6.5 million mobile health clinic visits each year, return on investment is $12 per patient. The Advisory Board report added, Healthcare organizations hosting mobile health clinics are not just saving money; they are also making a dent in the most vulnerable, safety-net patient populations. 60% of the patients visiting mobile health clinics are uninsured, and another 31% have insurance.

How Effective Are Mobile Clinics? As the healthcare industry seeks to reduce care disparities, address the social determinants of health, and promote value-based care, mobile health clinics have served to fill in the gaps.

When ED utilization rates are excessive, experts can conclude that there are critical primary care needs in a community.

In other communities, mobile health clinics have led to lower readmission rates, more symptom-free days, and better patient reports of quality of life. Mobile health clinics are also good at delivering on value-based care. Because these clinics focus on preventive and primary care, they can detect at-risk individuals and begin health interventions early, increasing the likelihood of recovery and reducing eventual health costs.

Mobile health clinics can also be effective at improving chronic disease management, the literature review authors explained. \u201cThe challenge of chronic disease management is sustaining adherence to the necessary medications and lifestyle changes, and quantitative evidence from multiple mobile health clinics signify that mobile clinics are effective in helping patients address these challenges,\u201d they wrote.

As stated from the Mobile Health Map (MHP) website in July 2022, the MHP is a collaborative research community whose goal is to evaluate and demonstrate the impact of mobile clinics. What follows are the latest statistics and insights captured through Mobile Health Map showing how mobile health clinics are playing a vital role in the U.S. healthcare system. These programs achieve good patient outcomes, boast impressive returns on investment, and reach underserved communities that otherwise experience barriers to accessing healthcare. Currently, there are an estimated 2,000 mobile clinics located across the country, representing all states and Washington, DC. Services include primary care, preventive screening, disease management, behavioral health, dental care, pre-natal care, and pediatric care. Addressing the triple aim of patient outcomes, quality, and cost, we find: \u2022 Mobile clinics are improving access to care with up to 6.5 million visits annually. \u2022 Mobile clinics mainly serve the uninsured (60%) and the publicly insured (31%), and generally operate in low-income communities.

New Mobile Medical Clinic ~ A Proposal Page 12 of 22 Mobile Clinics provide cost-effective prevention services that help people live long and healthy lives. On average each mobile health clinic saves 65 quality adjusted life years every year of operation. This means that each visit they save on average $1,600 due to this prevention. Mobile Clinics provide accessible care at a reduced rate to the healthcare system than Emergency Department visits. It is estimated that each mobile clinic results in 600 fewer Emergency Department visits every year. This means that each visit to a mobile clinic saves on average $200 (approximately one fifth of an emergency visit).

Describe how your project design and implementation reflects a commitment to include and represent the communities to be served. WAM specifically partners with schools/students from the most under-resourced communities in Northern California and under-represented in the music industry. GoTM intentionally centers girls/gender-diverse youth because of the chronic gender inequity and representation in the music industry. Only 2-3% of music producers and 12% of Billboard-charting songwriters are women or gender-diverse artists according to the latest USC Annenberg study and far fewer are BIPOC. More than 90% of WAM students are BIPOC and 96% come from low-income communities. The GotM program is free to all youth to remove economic barriers.

This ensures that our curriculum is led and created by artists from the communities we serve. Instructors are highly trained in creating culturally-responsive curriculum and facilitating youth co-creation of course objectives and project topics. Through our partnership with the San Francisco Department of Children, Youth, and Families, instructors receive regular evaluation and training to support and engage students of color who experience systemic racism and trauma. The GoTM curriculum is rooted in the National Media Arts/CA Arts Standards and is continually updated based on youth input to remain culturally relevant, student-centered and project-based, an approach rooted in active exploration, discovery, and direct learning that has been shown in studies to be more effective for historically marginalized students (2014 Life Sciences Education Study, New York Times). There is bilingual instruction/curriculum to engage ESL/bilingual students (over 40% of our students primarily speak Spanish). Student-led final projects are based on student interests/lived experiences, and have included musical projects about feminism, Black Lives Matter, and multilingual songs and podcasts in Spanish, Mandarin, Tagalog, as well as podcasts about issues in student\u2019s communities.
