As the anchor in the \narea\u2019s hunger relief infrastructure, CAFB provides \nmore than 50 million meals to people in need  \neach year by supplying food to hundreds of \nrates, and the rollback of pandemic-era government support,  \nthe rate of food insecurity in the region is still remarkably high. \nAccording to CAFB\u2019s latest Hunger Report, one in three people \nexperienced food insecurity in 2021. That means more than  \n1.2 million people locally were affected by food insecurity,  \nwith households of color and those with children \ndisproportionately affected.\nThe generous support of our community partners is what makes it possible  \nto provide the food that our neighbors across the region need to thrive.\nHERE\u2019S A BY-THE-NUMBERS LOOK AT THE IMPACT  \nYOU\u2019VE HELPED TO CREATE SO FAR IN 2023:\n69%\nof foods  \ndistributed  \nwere culturally  \nfamiliar items  \nin addition  \nto produce\n70%\nof foods distributed  \nsupport wellness  \n \nin salt and sugar,  \n13%\nof food  \ndistributed  \nwas protein\n48%\nof food  \ndistributed  \nwas fresh \nproduce\n    35 million\nmeals distributed across the Washington \nMetro Region versus 17 million   in 2019\nImpact by the Numbers\n9,747\nvolunteer shifts completed", "source": "collateral_image", "title": "002_CAFB_DonorInfographic_Q2_2023.pdf", "doc_id": "collateral_images_039", "chunk_id": 0, "date": "", "metadata": {"image_name": "col_002-010.png", "source_pdf": "002_CAFB_DonorInfographic_Q2_2023.pdf", "page_number": 1, "type": "infographic"}}, {"text": "This image was extracted from report page 1 in 003_CAFB_FoodPlus_Diabetes_Final.pdf, a file related to the Capital Area Food Bank.

Page/slide context: Pairing Food with Critical Services  \nto Enable Brighter Futures\nWith help from an array of retail grocers, manufacturers, and local growers, along with our \ngenerous supporters, we distribute more than 45 million meals every year through a network \nof hundreds of regional nonprofit organizations. That food provides critical and immediate \nassistance for the nearly half million people in our area who aren\u2019t always sure where their  \nnext meal will come from. \nBut we know that food alone won\u2019t solve hunger. Food insecurity, like so many problems \nfostered by longstanding racial injustices and systemic inequities in our area, isn\u2019t an isolated \nissue. People who need food assistance often require a variety of other additional resources to \novercome the obstacles presented by poverty.\nAnd hardships can add up. Having to decide between visiting the doctor and buying nutritious \ngroceries due to a lack of transit, for instance, can contribute to severe health problems \nand, in turn, make it even harder to consistently attend work. Such barriers have only been \nexacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately affected households \nthat were already contending with low incomes.\nTo address the root causes of hunger and inequity in our region, we need new approaches. \nThat\u2019s why now, and moving forward, we have a dual focus on addressing hunger today while \nalso piloting innovative models that will create longer-term food security tomorrow.\nThe Food Plus model includes a variety of pilot projects that \u201cbundle\u201d nutritious food with \nother critical services such as health care, skill development, education, and more. Food Plus \nis designed to incentivize the use of available support programs while saving participants time \nand eliminating the need for them to choose between services due to transportation, time, or \nother constraints.\nFood Plus is centered around the needs of the people we serve. Based upon input from our \nclients, CAFB is developing, exploring, and implementing multiple pilot projects to see which \nservice bundles make the largest impact for program participants, with an aim of scaling the \nmost effective ones.\nBy expanding beyond our traditional food provider network and working with organizations \nthat specialize in addressing challenges such as diet-related illness, underemployment, and the \nlack of local and affordable grocery options, we can meet people where they are and provide \nthem with food to help address their most pressing concerns.  \nWe believe that availability of and access to food\u2014both free and affordable\u2014are critical in \nenabling and encouraging greater participation in a thriving local economy. Food Plus is a vital \npart of ensuring the benefits of regional growth reach and benefit our entire community. \nFood Plus  \nPilot Initiatives:\nThe Capital Area Food Bank has been the backbone of the hunger relief \ninfrastructure in the Greater Washington region since 1980. Our mission is to \nhelp our neighbors thrive by creating equitable access to food and opportunity \nthrough community partnerships.\nFOOD TO ADDRESS \nHUNGER TODAY\nBRIGHTER FUTURES \nTOMORROW\nThis is where Food Plus comes in.\nOur ultimate aim is to develop \npathways for individuals to move \nfrom intensive support to less \nsupport, thereby creating paths \nout of poverty. With our partners, \nwe\u2019re creating places where \nthe food people need today is \nbundled with other services that \ncan drive transformational change \nin their lives.", "source": "collateral_image", "title": "006_CAFB_FoodPlus_TwoSheet_v5.pdf", "doc_id": "collateral_images_066", "chunk_id": 0, "date": "", "metadata": {"image_name": "col_006.png", "source_pdf": "006_CAFB_FoodPlus_TwoSheet_v5.pdf", "page_number": 1, "type": "full-page"}}, {"text": "This image was extracted from report page 2 in 006_CAFB_FoodPlus_TwoSheet_v5.pdf, a file related to the Capital Area Food Bank.

As a result, \nthe ability to access a well-stocked grocery store \nmatters to health outcomes. For many DC residents, \na full range of groceries are not available in their \ncommunity (see map 1). The maps below further \ndemonstrate the impact of unequal access to \nnutritious foods on certain parts of the region. \nLow-income individuals living in communities \nwith limited healthful food access tend to have \nless healthful diets and run a higher risk of chronic \ndisease\u2014such as various cancers, cardiovascular \ndisease, and Type 2 diabetes \u2014compared to \nindividuals living in higher-income communities.8 \nIn maps 2 through 4, food access disparities fall \nalong the east/west divide in the region. Areas \nthat are considered food deserts align with areas \nexperiencing high rates of food-related illnesses such \nas diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure. For \nexample, parts of Ward 7 in DC and Prince George\u2019s \nCounty in Maryland have a diabetes prevalence \nclose\u00a0to 15% and\u00a0an obesity prevalence\u00a0above 39%.9\n8   Evans, A., Banks, K., Jennings, R. et al.

Children have a more \ndifficult time learning. Adults struggle to concentrate. People \nof every age face higher rates of diet-related disease. Those \nimpacts ultimately affect the health of our communities,  \nand the vibrancy of our workforce and our local economies.  \nIn short, when people in our region don\u2019t have the food  \nthey need, it impacts all of us.\nHow the Capital Area Food Bank makes a difference for our neighbors\nThe Capital Area Food Bank\u2019s mission is to help our neighbors \nthrive by creating equitable access to food and opportunity \nthrough community partnerships. Since 1980, we\u2019ve been \nthe backbone of the hunger relief infrastructure in the greater \nWashington region.\nEach year, we supply the food for nearly 60 million meals \nto a network of hundreds of nonprofit organizations across \nDC, Maryland, and Virginia. Those meals provide critical and \nimmediate assistance to those in need.\nBecause we know it will take more than food to solve hunger, \nwe also work to address several of hunger\u2019s root causes by \npairing food with services like health, education, and job \ntraining through partnerships with other organizations.\n40% \nwas fruits  \nand vegetables \n11 million \nmeals worth of food distributed \nin DC last year.\n11% \nwas protein\nFOOD \nDISTRIBUTION \nLAST YEAR\nWe support a network of over 100 nonprofit partners in DC across \nall eight wards, including Thrive DC, Bread for the City, Friends of \nDouglas Center, Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, Food & Friends, \nDC Central Kitchen, and Urban Outreach. Over the last ten years, \nthe Capital Area Food Bank has distributed 105 million meals in \nthe District to neighbors experiencing food insecurity.\nThe Capital Area Food Bank\u2019s impact in DC\n38%  \nof people in DC are experiencing some \nlevel of food insecurity*\nFOOD INSECURITY  \nIN CAFB\u2019S DC \nSERVICE AREA\nHOW CAFB PROVIDES FOOD TO OUR COMMUNITY\nPB\nNONPROFIT\nPARTNER\nCAFB receives donations \nfrom grocers, growers,  \nand government sources. \nWe also purchase food.\nFood is prepared  \nfor distribution at \nour warehouses.\nCAFB\u2019s trucks \nbring food to \nlocations across \nDC, MD, and VA. \nPartner organizations \nprovide food from \nCAFB to individuals \nin need.\nCAFB supplies food to \nhundreds of nonprofit \norganizations including \npantries and soup \nkitchens, as well as new \nkinds of partners like \nhospitals and colleges. \nCAFB also delivers and \ndistributes food directly to \nindividuals in the community. \n*Source: CAFB Hunger Report 2024\nThe Facts About Hunger \nIN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA", "source": "collateral_image", "title": "015_CAFB_RegionalFactSheets_DC_Ward5.pdf", "doc_id": "collateral_images_361", "chunk_id": 0, "date": "", "metadata": {"image_name": "col_015-016.png", "source_pdf": "015_CAFB_RegionalFactSheets_DC_Ward5.pdf", "page_number": 1, "type": "infographic"}}, {"text": "This image was extracted from report page 2 in 015_CAFB_RegionalFactSheets_DC_Ward5.pdf, a file related to the Capital Area Food Bank.

Page/slide context: Food insecurity in DC\nHunger affects individuals the world over, on every continent \nand in every country. The capital region of the United States is \nno exception. Nearly 1.5 million people in our area experienced \nsome level of food insecurity last year, meaning they weren\u2019t \nalways sure where their next meal would come from. \nIn CAFB\u2019s DC service region, 38% of our neighbors are  \nfacing the difficult reality of food insecurity.\nHunger\u2019s impacts are far-reaching. Children have a more \ndifficult time learning. Adults struggle to concentrate. People \nof every age face higher rates of diet-related disease. Those \nimpacts ultimately affect the health of our communities,  \nand the vibrancy of our workforce and our local economies.  \nIn short, when people in our region don\u2019t have the food  \nthey need, it impacts all of us.\nHow the Capital Area Food Bank makes a difference for our neighbors\nThe Capital Area Food Bank\u2019s mission is to help our neighbors \nthrive by creating equitable access to food and opportunity \nthrough community partnerships.
