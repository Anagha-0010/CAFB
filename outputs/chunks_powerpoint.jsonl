{"text": "Spring 2024 Capital Area Food Bank Strategic Plan Refresh Executive Summary CAFB\u2019s current strategic plan, which originally covered years 2020-2025, was adopted at an inflection point in the organization\u2019s history and introduced a novel emphasis on addressing root causes of food insecurity. Since 2020, the organization has made major progress against its strategic objectives, even while responding to dramatic increases in food insecurity precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due in large part to the pandemic, the world has fundamentally changed around us: labor market changes, geopolitical and technology disruptions, curtailment of government benefits, inflation, and the changing food security landscape have accentuated pre-existing inequities. These changes have underscored the need for CAFB to continue its focus on root causes of food insecurity, while staying rooted in our role addressing hunger today \u2013 and helping internal and external stakeholders appreciate the need for both. As CAFB continues pursuing this dual goal, it will implement a 3-year extension on its current strategic plan, after which the next multi-year strategic plan will be developed.

Over the last 45 years, we have transformed from a small operation distributing 1 million meals to a complex, multi-site organization distributing 64 million meals in FY24. Our research shows that there are 1.5 million food insecure1 people in Greater Washington, and most of them are employed. Food insecurity in the DMV 1: Food insecurity as defined by the USDA is a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food. It can be chronic or intermittent. Addressing hunger today and tomorrow Years before the pandemic, the Capital Area Food Bank had enacted a new strategic plan emphasizing a dual focus on addressing hunger today and seeding innovative approaches that will have a lasting impact on longer term food security for tomorrow.
